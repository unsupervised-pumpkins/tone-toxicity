The NASDAQ Composite led indices lower after being up on the day more than 2% and then it ended up closing 2.2% lower. Nvidia itself actually finished the day down 3.2%. So they reported an actual profit of something like $62 billion and they ended up down on the day. Why? Because people are expecting that there is in fact an AI bubble. And that expectation is not unreal. Again, whenever there's a transformative technology, people seem to think that just because there is a bubble that means that the underlying technology is not transformative. If you look back at the history of investment, there is always a speculative bubble around brand new technologies and then",

So you remember Henry Ford because Ford ended up being a wildly successful company. But there were dozens of other automobile companies that were startups at the time that ended up crapping out. In fact, Ford had several of them before he actually started the Ford Motor Company. The same thing was true of the internet. When the internet bubble burst in 2000, everybody remembers pets.com as sort of the thing that that represented the era. But what we should remember is that actually the internet has completely transformed everybody's life. We all work on the internet. We all do commerce on the internet. We all interact on the internet. The the stock market bubble of 2000 did not mean the internet wasn't important. There were idiots like Paul Krugman who tried to suggest that it wasn't important. It was very important,",

So people are looking at the current AI boom and they're thinking that at some point here it has to crap out. Some of these companies are just not going to be able to develop the kind of margins or gross income that justifies the investment they are currently making. Open AAI being the most obvious example of a company that is not publicly traded, but has so many contracts with publicly traded companies, ranging from Oracle to Nvidia, that if it craps out, then that could take down a bunch of companies with it or at least severely damage their market capitalization. According to the New York Times, it would not be a stretch to describe this period of hyperactive growth in the tech industry as a historic moment. Nvidia said on",

Just 3 weeks ago, Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to be worth $5 trillion. Meaning Nvidia is now worth more according to the stock market than the entire economy of Germany. But some industry insiders say there is something ominous lurking behind all the bubbly news. They're looking at the eyepopping growth and the same stunning wealth creation as Jensen Huang and they see a house of cards. Even Nvidia's growth can be explained away because again, demand for the company's chips, it doesn't mean that people want to use AI. It means that companies are building giant AI systems in the hope that somebody will pay to use them eventually.",

At some point, the productivity generation from AI is going to have to start matching up to the investments that are being made. Evan Conrad, a chief executive of San Francisco Compute, a startup specializing in AI, says Stargate alone, if it does actually reach $500 billion, would be the largest infrastructure project in the world several times over. Stargate is, of course, a $500 billion data center project in the United States, enough to fund the Manhattan project 15 times over. It could pay for the entire Apollo moon pro program twice. So, the amount of investment at some point is going to have to be channeled into actual gains. Goldman Sachs estimates",

And so, people are betting on whether there's going to be an AI boom that justifies all this or an AI bust. And we don't know which way it's going, which is why people are freaking out. They're also freaking out because if AI does succeed, there will be some temporary job dislocation. There are a lot of jobs that will become obsolete. If you want to hear me discuss this with Batt Walsh, Andrew Cla and Michael Moles, go listen to our episode of Friendly Fire came out a couple of days ago. We discussed this at some length. The the history of job creation is that the economy becomes more productive. You get nicer things for cheaper prices. You work fewer hours. Your grandparents were working many more hours than you work.",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0007,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,295.12,338.24,"But it also means that there is with technological ch change significant job dislocation. people losing the kind of jobs they've historically held and then they have to find new jobs, retrain. One of the points that I made to Matt Walsh, who's very critical of AI, is that if you named the jobs that many people hold in today's economy to people living in 1997 when the internet was first really getting started, if you if people in 1997 say, ""Hey, this is going to destroy a huge number of jobs."" For example, if you're if you're able to buy everything from Amazon, a bunch of small mom and pop shops might go out of business, which is true. So what's going to happen to those jobs? Well, you know, they and their kids are going to end up doing online marketing, social media",

All these things would have been unthinkable in 1997. Amazon was a used bookstore company. I mean, that's what it was. It sold used books to start. And yet, we've generated millions and millions of jobs off of areas that we didn't even know exist. And this is just the way the economy tends to work. That doesn't mean that the anx and the heartburn about job dislocation are somehow false. And so two things can be true at once. We can be in a transformative amazing time for the economy and the uncertainty can be real and the concern can be real and it can't all be alleviated by the government. And so right now you have a lot of",

So, for example, there's been a lot of talk about housing, housing unaffordability, and it is true that housing is way less affordable than it was in say 2020 in just pure dollar terms. Why? Well, because we inflated the currency massively between 2020 and 2024. The inflationary policy that was pursued in bipartisan fashion, by the way, in 2020 during COVID when we had a massive artificial shutdown and the government paid everybody to stay home was then followed on in 2021 and 2022 by even more massively inflationary policy under",

Because when people didn't know what to do with their money, they figured, I'm going to plow that into the housing market. Because historically the housing market has been an excellent repository of wealth. The way that you got wealthy is you bought a house and then if you got richer maybe sold that house and bought another house that was bigger and kept upgrading your wealth level as what my parents did. Think what many Americans parents did. It's what I've done myself. However, there's some myth making right now about the price of housing in the United States. So Zor Mamani wins in New York and he shouts about housing unaffordability and of course he's right. New York is really really unaffordable. We talked yesterday on the",

It costs more to rent them out to somebody than it would be to keep them empty. Like the maintenance costs on it, the taxes on it actually cost more to rent than to just keep it empty. So you have 50,000 so-called ghost apartments in New York City. Okay, but this is also obscuring a simple truth. In many parts of the country, the prices in housing have been on the decline, not the incline. All righty, coming up, we'll get to some things people think about the economy that just are not quite true.

Look, gold started this year around $2,600 an ounce. By October, it was over $4,000 announced. Why? Global uncertainty. 2025 has been defined by trade wars.

And according to comment, housing prices have declined over the last year in several populous metropolitan areas outside of New York, Chicago, LA, and Seattle with the largest decreases seen mostly in Florida, Texas, and some southern and western cities. Now, what you'll notice about that is those are all red areas where, by the way, population is increasing. So when you have areas like LA or Chicago or Seattle or New York where population is leaving and the housing prices are increasing, you're reducing demand and yet somehow you are still having the prices go up. That is regulation. That is regulatory",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0016,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,670.0,713.68,"overreach. That is the rationale. According to Perplexity, according to our sponsors over at Comet, Austin saw median listing prices fall by nearly 15% over the last 3 years and about 6% year-over-year. Miami's prices have dropped 19% over the last 3 years and roughly 4 to 4.6% in the past 12 months. Why did this happen, by the way? Because when there was a gigantic rush during COVID to Florida and to Texas, then one of the things that happened is the p the housing prices went up, right? Same supply, higher demand, higher prices. Okay? But then what happened? Every developer in Florida decided to build. The building went nuts in Florida. The building went nuts in Dallas and Austin and Houston. And so now there's more",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0017,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,711.44,755.9200000000001,"inventory. And then the demand slacked a little bit. Now the prices are down. Tampa has experienced a 6.2% year-over-year decline. Dallas and Houston saw home values decrease by 3.9% and 1.9% respectively. Atlanta recorded a roughly 3.1% decrease in home values. There are a bunch of areas actually that have experienced year-over-year declines between 0.9% and 4.3%. Many of the areas in the rust belt in the Midwest saw home prices increase, but some of that is because a lot of those home prices were already fairly cheap. If you were looking at a house in in Cincinnati, it's not going to cost you what a house in say New York would cost. Nationally, US home values have actually remained mostly flat over the",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0018,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,753.519,798.399,"last year. So, it's important to look at the contrasting areas. The United States is not homogeneous. Saying that it's unaffordable to live in New York City does not mean it is just as unaffordable to live in Austin. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't affordability problems in Austin. Groceries particularly have been a major issue. And again, that's because the value of your dollar just is not worth what it once was because there are more dollars chasing the same number of goods. As Milton Freeman famously said over and over and over, inflation is anywhere and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. What he meant is you really get inflation as a factor of how much money the government is pumping into the economy. With that said, having to explain this like explaining",

And one of the things that they are falling into is this routine where they either say that people's feelings are fake, which you know I can say because again that's my show and I can say that facts don't care about your feelings but politicians feelings very often don't care about their facts. Howard Lutnik, the commerce secretary, he's been saying that the economic dispsia is fake news. Well, you know, it may be true that much of what is being distributed about the economy is fake news. That is Pepsia is not fake news by the polling data. >> It's just fake news. You've got so many factories being built.

You're going to see fours, you're going to see fives, and you're going to see 6% GDP growth under this president because the factories coming home, the tariffs are bringing them home. Okay. So again, you know, it is not true that the tariffs are bringing manufacturing home. That is not true by the statistics. However, some of the, you know, anst about the economy is in fact overstated. The idea that you absolutely cannot get a job anywhere. We have a 4.4% unemployment rate. Okay. By historic rates, that is actually close to full employment. And in many of the high-tech industries, we actually still have more job openings",

Meanwhile, the vice president is begging Americans for patience, which, you know, the problem with begging people for patience is that they are not patient. And even though we've made incredible progress, we understand that there's a lot more work to do. And the thing that I'd ask for the American people is a little bit of patience. This economy was not harmed in 10 months. It took a deliberate four-year administration that was making life harder for everyday Americans, that was importing foreign workers instead of giving jobs to American workers, that was overregulating, overt taxing, overspending, they were doing everything wrong. And as much progress as we've",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0022,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,919.68,964.399,"made, it's going to take a little bit of time for every American to feel that economic boom. Okay? >> So, we will see if that is true or if that is not true. Okay? But one of the things you actually do have to explain to the American people comes with some strings, right? If you explain, as I just did, that the economy is heterogeneous, that living in Florida and Texas is not the same thing as living in New York, and that blanket solutions are not going to work the same way, that that is a politically difficult thing to do, but it is a politically necessary thing to do because otherwise people are going to look at the solutions that you are proposing and when they don't work the way they think they should. When the housing affordability crisis in New York does not alleviate, they blame you for that. Right? You you see some of this in the marketing from the administration. So",

And one other quick quick piece of advice to people under the age of especially 25. The best thing you can do is get a job. Even if you're 19, 20 years old, 17 years old, the the younger you get a your first job, Ben, the more successful you will be in your life. So let's [snorts] talk about some of the issues that that people are themselves apparently feeling and talking about. The big one of course is the continuation of inflation. Obviously the rates of inflation have come down radically under President Trump. And and the thing and the thing that I keep talking about on the show is that it is true that President Trump has sort of",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0035,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1462.72,1502.96,"stabilized the inflation rate, but the thing that people are comparing the prices to are not the prices last year. What they're actually comparing the prices to in their heads are prices from 2020. And those prices are just not coming back because the only way to get those prices to come back would presumably be an actual economic downturn involving significant unemployment because we blew too much money in the economy. Unless you're going to suck amazing amounts of money out of the economy, those prices are basically going to stay where they are. And that is in fact Joe Biden's fault and not President Trump's fault. >> Well, okay, good point. So, first of all, let's let's um address the first point that you make, which is that uh we just did some numbers at Unleash Prosperity starting from the uh",

Um 87.5% almost 90% 87.5% of the inflation that you're feeling when you go to the grocery store, when you pay your rent, your utility bill, your medical bill, 87 12% of that happened under Biden, not Trump. And Trump is is right to say, ""Look, I inherited this inflation mess. I didn't cause it."" In his first, just some numbers. And in Trump's first term, his four first four years in office, the inflation rate was 2%. Biden comes in 18 months after entering office, the inflation rates 9.1%. And over the average of his presidency was about 5 to",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0037,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1540.799,1584.48,"5%. Today, the inflation rate is, you know, somewhere between 2 and a half and 3%. Now, that's a little too high. We want to get it down to the Fed target which is 2% which is the sort of rate of growth of the overall US economy. But Trump is right to say look I didn't cost this crisis and especially by the way Ben in the case of healthcare where if you really want to see a villain here for the high cost of living look at uh President Barack Obama who said that his signature achievement as president was to you remember this they passed Obamacare and uh people like me said this is going to blow a lid off of spending. it's not going to work.

Obamacare has led to a doubling to tripling of health care prices in the last 15 years. Thanks a lot uh Barack, you did a great job. So, you know, there are some other questions with regard to inflation that that I have and and one of them is the president has constantly called for a lowering of the interest rates and and to me I'm talking with investors. It doesn't seem like there is a lack of liquidity in the economy. Typically, you lower the interest rates when there's a lack of liquidity, when it feels like there's an economic contraction that's happening. You're not going to lower the interest rates when the economy is running hot and when the stock market continues to churn and when the inflation rate is still riding about 50% higher than the Fed's target rate. By the way, I'm a I'm a Vienna school guy, so I think that the inflation rate",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0039,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1623.279,1667.3600000000001,"target should actually be zero, not 2%. you know, putting that aside the [laughter] the attempt to, you know, push the Federal Federal Reserve into lowering those interest rates as though what we really have as a problem is spurring liquidity and consumption. Why Why is the president still pushing that? Wouldn't he be better off at this point basically just saying, ""Listen, the Fed policy is what the Fed policy is, and let's, you know, work on deregulation and freer trade, for example."" So, let me put this in a big broad perspective. Uh, because I'm what you call a supply cider with, you know, Art Laugher and Larry Cuddlo and Ronald Reagan and, uh, Steve Forbes. And the reason they call us supply ciders is that we believe that the best solution",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0040,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1664.88,1707.279,"for almost every problem in the economy is to grow the economy, increase the supply of goods and services, increase production. Because it's very simple and and it's amazing how many even PhD economists don't understand this universal truth. Ben, if you if the economy produces more apples, what happens to the price of apples? >> Price drops. >> They go down, right? So, if you want less inflation, produce more. And in fact, even you sort of start, you know, we're saying, well, you know, maybe we're going to need uh, you know, a recession to lower prices. That's not true. You the way you bring down uh prices is to produce more and get people working, getting people to produce more.",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0041,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1705.6,1749.2,"That's point number one. Point number two, I believe that there is way, way, way too much emphasis in Washington, on Wall Street on what the Fed is going to do. The Fed does not control the interest rate. Let me say that again. The Fed does not control the interest rate. The you know, you said you're an Austrian economist, so you know, the the interest rate is set by the law of supply and demand for credit. And so, uh, all the Fed controls is the overnight interest rate. Do do you borrow at the overnight interest rate rate? You don't. I don't. almost nobody does except for banks. And so my my point here is that >> and even Trump and I love Trump. I'm a Trump guy. I was one of his adviserss. I think he's an amazing president. But he's wrong on this. Whether the Fed",

And I'll give you evidence of that. Ben, back when Biden was president, the Fed lowered interest rates three times in 2024. And what happened to the mortgage rate? They went up. >> It went up. So why is that? Because the what affects the long-term interest rate is the is what we call inflationary expectations. That if the if you believe let let me keep this very simple, Ben. If you believe that the interest rate I mean the inflation rate is going to be 5%. Are you going to lend me money at 3%. >> No. That'd be idiotic, >> right? Well, that sometimes a lot of",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0043,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1787.84,1832.48,"idiotic thinking in Washington. We got to grow our way out of this. I'm very proud of the fact that because of so many of Trump's great policies on reducing taxes, reducing regulations, producing more energy, uh we are seeing um we're we're starting to see the inflation rate uh go down and we've achieved almost 4% economic growth. That's a that's a phenomenal rate of growth over the last 6 months. >> Okay. So, meanwhile, there are a lot of worries obviously about AI and and not just about AI itself. I I tend to be an optimist when it comes to tech. um but about whether we are actually in a stock market bubble because the vast majority of gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for example have acred to the MAG7. The MAG7 represent an extraordinary percentage at this point of of all stock market growth over the",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0044,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1830.399,1875.12,course of the last several years. Obviously Nvidia's numbers are eye watering and eye popping according to the markets. The the the company Nvidia is now worth more than the entire economy of the country of Germany. Uh and and so you know when you when when you look when you look at Nvidia and then you look at the sort of circular deals that are being made between say Nvidia and private companies like Open AI where OpenAI is talking about expending $1.4 trillion in capital over the next 10 years just on data centers and data infrastructure and they generated a $20 billion return this year. There are a lot of people including me are pretty nervous that we may be in an AI bubble. Not to say that AI isn't important but two things can be true at once. AI can be really important and transformative and also whenever you get a new technology there tends to be a,
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0045,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1873.039,1916.559,"lot of speculation in that area and then it tends to consolidate down into the most productive companies. This happened with the internet. Hell, it happened with cars. So, [clears throat] would we be surprised if this happened with AI as well? >> Well, I could probably talk to you for about 45 minutes about AI and and there's a lot in that question, but I'll just make a couple of observations on this. Number one, I mean, I'm so uh envious of of younger people like you. I'm 65. But you know, especially people in their 20s and 30s, you're going to see the most amazing economic transformation over the next 25 or 30 years. I mean, it's amazing what is coming. Uh just to give you an example, Ben, I just joined the board of a company called Light Speed and we build",

All all trucks will be automated. You know, already in a lot of part of the country, Uber and uh and uh and u lift uh cars are automated. So, you get in the car and by the way, this dramatically reduces prices because you don't have to have a human driving the car. A machine uh does. This is very much like the revolution that happened in agriculture 100 to 150 years ago where it used to be 35 every out of every hundred Americans was working in the fields and now two out of every hundred work in the fields and we produce more food than we can possibly consume. And so this is going",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0047,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1953.279,1998.24,"to be an exciting period uh if ahead. You asked the question of whether there's a bubble maybe, you know, I'm a little nervous about it too. But think about this. I mean, you want to, you know, go USA. We have seven companies, the the magnificent seven. You know, you mentioned a few of them. Amazon, Apple, Google, uh Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta that are worth more than all of the companies in Europe combined. So we we need to dominate the AI and robotics age the the way we've dominated the internet age. How did we do that as a country? What was the key to making America so so completely dominant in the internet age?",
ben_shapiro_PGtFTXj6kZc_0048,ben_shapiro,PGtFTXj6kZc,1996.559,2039.919,"You know what it was back in the mid 1990s when of all people Bill Clinton a Democrat was president and a Republican Congress. We passed a bill that basically said we are going to make the internet tax free, subsidy free, uh, and regulation free and we just created the wild west. We just said go out there and build these companies and we built these amazing amazing companies. You're right, there's going to be some sorting out. You may recall that in in 2000 there was a crash in the technology market. It was a pretty deep crash because prices did get overvalued. Um, but you know that's the way markets work.

I mean, it is that large of a shift. And so there is real concern and and I understand it on an individual level about the job dislocation that's going to happen, right? There's no question that, for example, automating trucks is going to make things more efficient. It's going to bring down prices for the vast majority of Americans. Where do the truck drivers go is always the question. And so, you know, I think that this is one of the dangers for the Trump administration or for any administration that's in power because there is no the creative destruction that Chumper describes when it comes to markets is real and there is a destruction half to that creative destruction. Meaning, you know, in 10 years all those people will have new jobs, but what happens in the meantime? What would you say about the potential",

Well, the whole idea, let's just start with what economics is all about. It's about increasing production of goods and services. And the the idea is to create as many resources as possible with the least amount of of work, right? And and and labor. And that's what's essentially happening with this just like it happened with the age of the tractor and and and then the age of the computer and now the age of uh AI.

I I I believe just one tip for young people and I said it before, but I'm going to say it again.

So one of the big controversy that has broken out in New York is that just the other night a bunch of anti-semites and and I use that word advisedly because of what they were yelling gathered outside of an Orthodox congregation in Manhattan's upper east side chanting from New York to Gaza globalize the inifat.

Calling to globalize the inifata in New York means go kill people in New York. That's what that means. So why were they outside a synagogue yelling? I mean by by the way they're also chanting resistance. You make us proud. Take another settler out. They consider every Jew in Israel to be a settler. I don't know how else to describe that other than Jew hatred. I mean that's what that is. They were literally outside a synagogue in New York. What were they protesting?

He believes every New Yorker should be free to enter a house of worship without intimidation and that these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law. That is an insane statement. Nothing that was happening in the synagogue violates international law. First of all, there there are a few problems. One, international law can go screw because it's the most useless pile of crap that ever was conceived by man or or anyone else. It's ridiculous. There is no such thing as international law. There are just international interests. The notion that there is a governing body that decides what is right and wrong. that includes Russia and China and Iran isn't it's absurd. It's ridiculous.",

Now of course when you dig beneath the hood the question is what's the nature of the compromise? But Americans are not actually in fact begging for kind of the wild partisanship that was demonstrated by the Democrats during the latest government shutdown on political violence. 83% of Americans say it is never okay for people to use violence to achieve a political goal.

So that under the hood question that I think is the big one that is that is dividing the country basically right down the middle is the nature of change in America.

The age breakdown is that as you get older, people think things are happening too fast. Democrats overwhelmingly think that things are happening at a reasonable pace, 2:1.

That is the real key to this poll. No one is saying that the change is happening too slowly, that we need to accelerate the pace of change in the United States. No one is saying that. Again, that's fascinating because what that means is that the sort of radical left which wants to accelerate change is not going to be popular. and a radical right that also wishes to radically decelerate like change in the opposite direction or to a place that America never historically has been. That is not what Americans want. Virtually all Americans believe either that the pace of change is about right or that's",

They are not in favor of it. They certainly don't want things accelerating from here. So any accelerationism from either side is likely to be rejected by the American people. Okay. Meanwhile, our media are very much focused on accelerationism and partisanship and exacerbating it. Again, this is not to avoid blame for partisan politicians who also do it, but I have to say that that things are increasingly stupid here in the United States, like truly stupid. So, yesterday, the big",

We we put up their video yesterday. Okay, this is a bunch of Democrats ranging from Senator Alyssa Slotkin of Michigan to Representative Crow, Jason Crowe of Colorado, calling on members of the military to disobey illegal orders. Now, we should note what this is and what it isn't. There's what it says and then there's what it implies. And now we're playing in the dumb space between them. So, what it actually says is not illegal. Telling people they don't and and cannot obey illegal orders, that of course is true. Duh. Right? Right? If somebody gives you an order to go mow down a bunch of school children for no reason and there would be no",

Okay. So the question becomes why they filmed that video and the answer is because the implication is that the Trump administration is routinely giving illegal orders and thus you should just disobey the Trump administration. So once again, we are living in stupid land where Democrats will interpret this video as saying nothing new and Republicans will interpret this video as saying that members of the military should disobey legal orders, not illegal orders. Here is the video. Like us, you all swore an oath [music] >> to protect and defend this Constitution. And >> right now, the threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but from right here at home. >> Our laws are clear. You can refuse",

And there's not a court in America that could convict them of sedicious behavior punishable by death. Right? that that is actually not sedicious behavior punishable by death. You may say that it is sedicious behavior, but saying it's punishable by death means like a legal violation. They would have to go to trial. You'd have to make the claim that they were actually inciting treason against the government. Hey, by the way, unlawfully failing to follow an order is not in fact punishable by death, even in the United States military.",

Are we going back to 2017 when everybody just went nuts with their hair on fire about the crap that he was putting on at that time X or what what was called Twitter at the time? Like, we've done this before. these sort of bizarre news cycles where Trump says something that is unccalibrated to say the least and then everybody runs around like a chicken with their head cut off.

And then there's the reality which is Trump is not going to do any of that stuff which we all know obviously. When Caroline Levit was asked if President Trump wants people executed, here's what she had to say at the White House. >> Just to be clear, does the president want to execute members of Congress? No. Let's be clear about what the president is responding to. Uh because many in this room want to talk about the president's response, but not what brought the president to responding in this way.

Democrats of course decided to jump on this and they make hay out of it as one would. So apparently Democrats put out a statement from Mark Kelly, Alyssa Slotkin, Jason Crowe, Crystal Luzio, Maggie Goodender, and Chrissy Hulahan who are the people in the video in which they said, ""What's most telling is that the president considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law.

They're going to, you know, rely on the literal thing that they said, which again, understandable, and they're going to avoid the implication of what they said. This is what Representative Crow had to say in his own defense. >> To be clear, we are not calling on folks right now to debate to to disobey any type of unlawful order. Right? There is very real and deep concern about what this president has threatened to do over and over again. Uh there are three more years left of this administration.

President Trump again went too far in his comments which like I know like we've seen him for 10 years. Come on. And then everybody went nuts in response. Okay. Now there's sort of a parallel stupid story and that is that the president and vice president were not actually invited to the funeral for Dick Cheney. So I have a rule about funerals.

And then also it was Joe Biden who presided over the complete collapse of American support in Afghanistan, handing the entire country back to the Taliban.

Um, and and as North Carolina goes, I think honestly the Senate can go. Um and and when you talk about having a hold, you know, we we talk about a three seat majority uh in in the Senate right now for the Republicans, um you know, that gets pretty dicey if we cannot hold on to North Carolina. >> That's exactly right.

But what I mean here is that the response to Jeffrey Epste has been quite fascinating. Many of the figures who have been largely associated with the question asking about Jeffrey Epstein, it turns out that some of them are in fact associates of Jeffrey Epstein.

After that documentary was made, he then used that as a sort of entree card to make a documentary about Sarah Palin.

He ended up doing a a very short stint of jail time and now of course he has his show The War Room where the media call him up routinely for quasi leaks because I'm not sure how really empowered his access is to the administration but they're constantly using him the media as a sort of window into the dark side of the Trump administration which is of course something that Steve really loves. Now the reason that Steve has become an issue is because Steve along with many other people who are attempting to rest control of the MAGA movement away from President Trump. Their assumption is,

And so any attempt to peg President Trump to a quote unquote MAGA ideology is destined to fail because President Trump could at one point articulate a version of MAGA in which support for Ukraine is bad.

There is no shadow president to President Trump. There is no one who is defining his program except for President Trump.

Epste replied, ""First to protest at Clinton and then at Trump, lots of people very angry at our friendship."" Bannon responded, ""It's an op, dude. I do this for a living.

And at the same time that you're maintaining what was, which is a good thing. If you throw a a bunch of sand into the gears with the tariffs, what you end up doing is creating confusion.

Again, when when the president said deport all the illegal immigrants, I never thought that he meant that literally. I don't think anyone thought that he meant that literally because it was never going to happen. We weren't going to take 15 to 20 million illegal immigrants and simply deport them wholesale. what President Trump did that's popular when you break down his actual immigration policy which is still one of his more popular policies. When you break down what he's actually doing is it's popular but that's not the headline. Well, when we talk about winning the presidency in 2028, we should look back for a moment at how Republicans have done with the Latino Hispanic vote. So, I asked our sponsors",

Reagan won 37% in 1980 and 34% in 1984. Now again, it was easier to win with those percentages when the country was significantly less Hispanic Latino. The percentage that you need to win of that vote in order to win the presidency has gone up because there are more Hispanic and Latino voters as a percentage of the population now than there were in 1980. 1988, George HW Bush won 30%. 1992 he won 25%.

In 2020 he won 32% and he lost. And in 2024, he won somewhere between 42 and 46% and he won.

That topic is, I think, the most important thing happening in the country. It was a hot topic last week, but I wanted to take some time to really gather my thoughts and speak on it in coherent fashion, holistic fashion. That topic is the fragmentation of the political right. That fragmentation is being caused purposefully by a splinter faction of people led by a young man named Nick Fuentes. They call themselves the Gropers. They are white supremacists. They hate women, Jews, Hindus, many types of Christians, brown people of a wide variety of backgrounds, blacks, America's foreign policy, and America's Constitution. They admire Hitler and Stalin. And that splinter faction is now",

Now, before we explain what's been happening, let's make one thing clear. This is not about free speech or cancellation. It was never about free speech or cancellation. Free speech has a definition, the right to speak free of governmental coercion. I believe in it, of course. I've always defended it. Criticism of bad speech is in fact just a form of free speech.

In fact, we used to call that one of the key aspects of conservatism. It is not cancellation to refuse to signal boost Hitler's supporters like Nick Fuentes. It is not cancellation to criticize Tucker Carlson for rhetorically fluffing Nick Fuentes and other anti-American crackpots.

The issue here is that Tucker Carlson decided to normalize and fluff Nick Fuentes and that the Heritage Foundation then decided to robustly defend that performance.

This of course ticked her off.",

He said, ""I'm withdrawing my support and endorsement of Congresswoman Marjgerie Taylor Green of the great state of Georgia."" He said, ""All I see wacky Marjorie do is complain, complain, complain."" He said, ""It seemed to all begin when I sent her a poll stating she should not run for senator or governor. She was at 12% and didn't have a chance, unless, of course, she had my endorsement, which she wasn't about to get. She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore. But with 219 Congress men and women, 53 US senators, 24 cabinet members, almost 200 countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can't take a ranting lunatics call every day.""

And so she responded by saying, ""President Trump just attacked me and lied about me."" Always playing the victim, Marjgerie Taylor Green. I haven't called him at all, but I did send these text messages today. Apparently, this is what sent him over the edge, the Epstein files. And of course, he's coming hard after me to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next week's votes to release the Epstein files.

So again, this is the the idea from Marjgery Taylor Green is that President Trump has basically betrayed MAGA because of Epstein, but also has betrayed MAGA because she has a different definition of MAGA. And this brings us to what's actually going on under the surface here. Marjorie Taylor Green started caring about the Epstein files in a serious way with regard to President Trump about the time that she got angry at President Trump's foreign policy with regard to the Middle East. That seems to be the pattern here. She, Thomas Massie, and a wide variety of commentators seem to get very exercised",

And what made them mad is that President Trump actually is not anti-Israel the same way that they are. And this is met with mainstream media approval, of course. I mean, listen, Marjgerie Taylor Green is making pretty clear what she thinks is happening here. Here she was blaming Israel for Jeffrey Epstein. Again, without any evidence. And if there's evidence, present it. I'm all in favor of all Jeffrey Epste files being released. All of it. The reason I think the president didn't want all of that released is because he was tired of talking about it and because his own FBI had told him there was no there there.",

If that's true, whoever engaged in it is evil. Full stop. Bar none. That's just basic morality.

No evidence whatsoever because she doesn't like Israel and also because she has some peculiar views, shall we say, about Jews. She of course believes that the United States is enthralled to the Israeli, particularly President Trump. She thinks that President Trump is somehow controlled by the Israelis. Here she was on Steve Bannon's show. Steve C. Bannon, of course, is on the same side of this argument because he too would like to seize control of the MAGA movement.",

Here she is suggesting that the president of the United States is somehow being manipulated by the Israelis.

Yes, it was on behalf of Israel. >> Well, I mean that that's kind of a strange supposition given the fact that again Israel was doing the vast majority",

These are the same people who suggested that bombing the Ford nuclear reactor was somehow going to lead to World War II and full-scale American involvement in Middle East warfare, which of course never happened. And again, it's not just Marjgery Taylor Green. It is also Thomas Massie who takes the same viewpoint. This is the reason why they're focused on Epste. Okay, let's be clear about this.

President Trump and his advisers are rushing to try to lower prices for American consumers after voters sent a warning shot to Republicans this month over the high cost of living. Following the recent election, Trump's aids have urged the president to focus on affordability.

There are one of them is a plan by President Trump that is a good plan which is to actually just give people money in their health savings accounts and let them use that how they want. That creates competition. It allows them to decide how much healthcare they actually want. Democrats are upset because they say that that will death spiral the ACA, the Obamacare marketplaces because essentially what the Obamacare marketplaces are are forcing young, healthy people to buy comprehensive plans they don't need in order to subsidize older, sicker people with pre-existing conditions. That's what they are. Trump instead would like to return power to the people by allowing them the elective ability to buy healthcare of their choice. And Democrats don't want that. According to",
ben_shapiro_TkvYWPAz1gM_0287,ben_shapiro,TkvYWPAz1gM,2013.76,2057.679,"the Washington Post, the scenario smacks of deja vu with lawmakers and experts acknowledging the seemingly inter interminable battle around the 15-year-old health law. Republicans long struggled to deliver an AC alternative that can pass Congress and the return of a dynamic from Trump's first term that repeatedly ended in failure. Again, Democrats are always going to have an upper hand here as long as we're talking about subsidized marketplaces. Always. Because they can always outbid everybody. And Americans have an unfortunate habit when it comes to the polls. They're constantly saying they want to cut spending and cut the debt and cut the deficit. And then when asked if they want to spend money from the government on stuff that they want, the answer is always yes. Which is why, according to the Washington Post, about 3/4 of Americans say Congress should extend the",

According to the CBO, permanently extending the subsidies would increase the number of insured people by nearly 4 million across the next decade at a cost of $350 billion to taxpayers. Now, the question that we should be asking, of course, is whether your coverage through ACA, particularly if you're young and healthy, improves your health outcome. But nobody actually cares about that. We don't actually talk about the thing we're supposed to be talking about, which is quality of your health care, do you get the doctor that you want, what is the price of that. The reality is that when it comes to healthcare in the United States, there's constant conversation about how much we spend on healthcare. That is true. But here's a",

As you can see, compared to other countries, it's kind of a straight line. There's some outliers, but in fact, there was a divergence. There was a divergence here. And so, I asked our sponsors and friends over at Comet, which is a project of perplexity. When did the US's healthcare spending per capita begin to exceed competitors based on GDP per capita? According to our sponsors over comet, US healthcare spending per capita began to consistently exceed that of comparable wealthy countries both in absolute terms and as a share of GDP starting in the 1980s and rapidly accelerating through the 1990s and 2000s far outpacing GDP per capita growth and competitor nations",
ben_shapiro_TkvYWPAz1gM_0290,ben_shapiro,TkvYWPAz1gM,2139.28,2184.079,"spending. So I then asked how much does Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare, how much do these contribute to this dynamic? And comet answers, Medicare and Medicaid have been major contributors to the growth and high level of US healthcare spending. Each accounting for a sizable share of national health expenditure since their inception, while the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, has had a complex effect, dampening spending growth rates in some areas, but increasing total coverage and thus increasing costs. Medicare represented about 21% of total US healthcare spending as of 2023. That is up from 10% in 1970 and 19% in 1990. Medicaid accounts for about 18 to 19% of total national health expenditures.",

So, if the costs have risen disproportionately from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s on, might that have to do with the gigantic government expenditures that have eaten up a bigger and bigger portion of our healthcare spending overall? And so, the question becomes, as always, how do you generate lower prices? And the answer to generate lower prices is more supply, not higher demand, which is what everyone keeps focusing on. What if we create higher demand with subsidies? Well, then the prices will go up. What if we get more people on health insurance by using government dollars to do it?

That is particularly true in the realm of healthcare where Democrats seem to have played a a wonderful trick on the American people. They said they were going to solve the affordability crisis in healthcare with Obamacare. And then it turns out that the prices of health insurance skyrocketed. People don't have the coverage that they want. And now they're saying that if they don't get further subsidies, then obviously affordability will be very, very difficult. So it's always this constant spiraling blackmail game where if if you don't give them more money then they say there's an affordability problem and then you give them more money it fails and then they require more money in order to make that more money work.

So when you hear people on the left say well the problem with healthare is we don't subsidize it enough actually the subsidies per capita the government subsidies of healthcare in the US are way higher than any other industrialized nation. So the the answer that'll be given by members of the left is well that's just",
ben_shapiro_TkvYWPAz1gM_0298,ben_shapiro,TkvYWPAz1gM,2475.599,2520.56,"because of the evil insurance companies and their profit motive. So h how do we actually bring down the prices? Well, that's a that's a big topic and we don't have as much time for that that broader topic of healthcare uh costs. But the one thing I'll say, the one core element of this, Ben, that your listeners can appreciate, the one thing we did that is the original sin of why American healthcare is more expensive than every other country in the world is what we did in World War II in its aftermath. So, I think you know the story, Ben, which is that we imposed wage and price controls in World War II because we're worried that with all the men off to war, there wouldn't be a labor force and there would be spiraling wages and that would lead to inflation. That would be a bad thing. So, the Roosevelt administration literally",
ben_shapiro_TkvYWPAz1gM_0299,ben_shapiro,TkvYWPAz1gM,2518.4,2563.04,"passed a schedule where if you were a mechanic, you could make this much an hour. If you were a barber, you could make that much an hour. But the loophole was employers fe fig figured out they could offer health insurance to people uh and that would evade the wage controls. And then after the war was over, the wage controls were lifted. But the Eisenhower administration decided that they were going to exempt from taxation uh the value of your health insurance. So if you made a h 100red bucks in wages that you pay income taxes on, social security taxes, Medicare taxes, state and local taxes, but $100 in health insurance would have no taxes. So what happened? All of a sudden, all these things that never used to be categorized as covered by health insurance got covered by health insurance. and you as a worker didn't know how much you were paying for your health insurance because",
ben_shapiro_TkvYWPAz1gM_0300,ben_shapiro,TkvYWPAz1gM,2560.88,2604.319,"your employer bought it for you in theory. Of course, you're still it's still being taken out of your paycheck. But that system, that 80-year-old system of your employer being the middleman of buying your health insurance instead of you buying it for yourself, that was the fundamental distortion that has led to every other problem in the healthare system. So when we look at the healthare system now, President Trump has been suggesting something that has been suggested by Republicans probably as long as I've been alive, which is the better use of health savings accounts instead of sending money directly to insurance companies via your employer. Instead, what we really should be doing is allowing particularly younger people to decide on where they want to spend their money. How would that impact health care in the United States?",

Because unless you reform the insurance system alongside with health savings accounts, health savings accounts can't really work. So, let's say every American had 2,000 bucks in a health savings account. That's great for your mammograms and your annual checkups and your lab tests, but if you get hit by a bus or you have a stroke or you have a $100,000 hospital bill for whatever reason, that $2,000 health savings account is not going to go very far. So, you still need something like insurance. And the big problem, the thing that Obamacare did that was the most damaging of all the things Obamacare did was it created a one-sizefits-all federal regulatory architecture for insurance that people buy on their own. Remember I mentioned that most people get insurance through",

A lot of people through Medicare and Medicaid get insurance through the government, but there's about 30 million people or so and 50 million in theory who could buy insurance individually just like they buy car insurance or homeowners insurance or what have you. That's the the the spine the the foundation of a free market health care system is people buying their own insurance. And that requires you to deregulate Obamacare. And the trick there is you cannot deregulate Obamacare without 60 6 votes in the Senate because the regulatory aspects of Obamacare require a filibuster proof majority to to reform.

So, we have these, as you mentioned, we have these uh Biden era enhanced subsidies. There were subsidies originally in the so-called Affordable Care Act that were enacted. It was passed in 2010, but they didn't go into effect until 2014, and those have been trucking along and defaying the cost for some people of the high premiums in Obamacare. But during COVID, the Biden administration with the Democratic Congress passed these enhanced subsidies uh that basically allowed a lot of wealthy people to be eligible for",

Those uh that was supposed to be temporary. It was supposed to expire in 2023. Then the Democrats extended it to 2025. And so it's expiring at the end of the year. And Democrats are trying to blame Republicans if they expire. It was Democrats who passed the law that expires. It's their fault. If they they wanted to pass something permanent, they could have done it when they were in charge. But here's the thing. So, you hear a lot of Republicans say, ""Well, let's just let the subsidies expire. What's the big deal? It's not our fault."" And and that's a I understand a sentiment and I sympathize with it a lot. But here's the strategic point that I'm trying to make is that if we want to reform these regulations in Obamacare, we need 60 votes in the Senate. In the current Senate, that means we need all",
ben_shapiro_TkvYWPAz1gM_0305,ben_shapiro,TkvYWPAz1gM,2769.76,2814.7200000000003,"the Republicans, 52, and we need eight Democrats. So, can we get eight Democrats to help us reform some of the regulations in Obamacare? And I pitched an idea in the Washington Post about a month ago where we trade a a temporary extension/phase out 1 to two years of those enhanced subsidies in exchange for that 60 vote form of deregulation of Obamacare because the deregulation would be permanent because you to reenact it, you'd have to get 60 votes again to change it again. Um and that and it would be a temporary uh win for the Democrats on the subsidy side. So let's do that. Uh and in that way we can actually make the individual market for health insurance more affordable. And if you want a free market health care",

If we can't help people buy insurance on their own, we're never going to have a free market system for everybody. And I think that that is the biggest point here is that that our system is a mess. It is it is a mixture of nationalized healthcare through Medicare and Medicaid and heavily subsidized healthcare through Obamacare and then actual private health insurance which has been made very difficult to actually obtain employer based health insurance. It is it is indeed a complete mess and and basically the only way to unwind it is going to have to be peace meal piece by piece with with hard deregulatory work that is unrewarding in the short term and perhaps more rewarding in the long term.

This has been a thing for a very long time, the talk about how black women are are expected to straighten their hair as opposed to wearing their hair naturally when they go into their jobs.

The first time he criticized Trump was on January 23rd, 2020 when he commented on a video of law professor Jonathan Turley talking about Trump's first impeachment.

If you actually want to bring down prices, if you actually want affordability, we know the things that make affordability happen here on planet Earth. They are free markets, deregulation, they are free trade, comparative advantage. That's what brings prices down. Now, that's not going to affect everybody equally beneficially. Some people are going to do a lot better than others. Some people presumably will be the victims of what Joseph Shumpeter the economist called creed of destruction. Every time you have a new industry or a more competitive business that comes up, somebody loses in that particular zero sum game. But the thing about the market is that it has many iterations. And so even if you lose in that particular game, you then get to come back and do",

It's why when there are people out there who are critical of quote unquote luxury products, we have to understand that everything that you now consider to be a necessity, a staple of your life, was once a luxury product. The food that you eat at your table is significantly more diverse than the food that your great-grandparents ate. Why? Because at one point it was a luxury for rich people and then it turned out a lot of people wanted it and there was competition to bring it to the people and the prices went down. That was true of cars. It was true of microwaves. It was true of centralized air conditioning. It is true of your cell phone. Literally every product that you use was once a luxury product. It's why when you go back go back and watch the old movie Wall Street and you see Gordon Gecko walking around with a cell phone,",

And now every single person, including the poorest American, has a cell phone. Okay, that's what free markets do. But it seems that no one is even willing to argue for free markets these days anymore. And then why are we surprised when we disappoint? because if you keep using a screwdriver to try and knock in the nail, you're unlikely to be successful. So, there's a lot of anx on the Republican side of the aisle about the the state of the economy and also about the Trump affordability issues. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessett, who of course understands capitalism better than I do, Scott Bessant, he says that we are going to bring prices down over the next years and months. I can",

Now we are starting to see prices level off, come down. You know, ga gasoline is down, interest rates are down, so mortgages are down.",
ben_shapiro_9tBJ87oJgqg_0389,ben_shapiro,9tBJ87oJgqg,2794.56,2839.04,"And I think we are making substantial progress on that. And I think over the coming months in the next year, uh prices are going to come down. >> Okay. Well, that may very well be true. I hope that that's true. I think one of the ways the price has probably come down is if sometime next year when the Supreme Court rules on tariffs and probably strikes down a lot of the tariffs, the markets open up again, which would be very, very good. But I'll tell you what's not going to bring prices down is things like proposing 50-year mortgages. So, President Trump over the weekend decided that he was going to promote what he called 50-year mortgages. That President FDR had promoted the 30-year mortgage and under President Trump there would be a 50-year mortgage. Okay. And the problem, of course, with",
ben_shapiro_9tBJ87oJgqg_0390,ben_shapiro,9tBJ87oJgqg,2837.52,2881.68,"the 50-year mortgage is that it skews the risk incentive cycle. What a 50-year mortgage actually will do is create a bubble in real estate as more and more people take out a 50-year mortgage on which they will presumably pay tons and tons and tons of interest. And then, don't worry, 20 years down the road, everybody will complain about the interest payments that they are making and how much more they are paying than the actual principal. And then we'll have a 75-year mortgage. And meanwhile, the prices will continue to go up. That doesn't generate actual lowering of prices. What generates actually again when you have a supply demand problem increasing the demand without increasing the supply does not actually lower the price it increases the price. If you want to increase the supply and lower the demand or just increase the supply and maintain",
ben_shapiro_9tBJ87oJgqg_0391,ben_shapiro,9tBJ87oJgqg,2879.92,2924.319,"the same demand or even increase supply faster than demand, you will get lowered prices. Okay? Okay, for the same reason when President Trump says that he is going to push out a $2,000 tariff dividend to Americans, that the amount of money the federal government has received in via the tariffs allows for the payment of $2,000 to every American family. That is inflationary. It's a stimulus check that is going to increase prices because that's just helicopter money. Helicopter money means that everyone has more money in their pocket and then they take that money and they spend that money then the prices temporarily go up. None of this is counterinflationary. President Trump put out a statement saying, ""People that are against tariffs are fools. We are now I assume that means Milton Friedman and Frederick",

A dividend of at least $2,000 a person, not including high-income people, will be paid to everyone. Well, Scott Besson, the Treasury Secretary said, ""Well, I don't know about that $2,000 dividend thing."" >> He also promised this morning a dividend a dividend of at least $2,000 a person, not including high income people. How is he going to pay that dividend of $2,000 a person? >> It's not about taking in the revenue. It's about rebalancing. >> And the the revenue occurs early on and",

The $2,000 dividend could come in lots of forms in lots of ways, George. U you know, it could be just the the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. You know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on social security, deductibility of auto loans. >> Okay. So, you know, again, you know, the fact that they have to keep walking this back, it's not centralized government policy is not going to fix the affordability problem. It isn't. Historically, it has not. Name a massive government intervention that made the",

Really, name like one, please explain how, unless what you're talking about is so thoroughly screwing the economy that you end up with a deflationary cycle like the 1930s. That you could theoretically do. You could really screw up the economy so badly that demand drops off a cliff and then you have people burning their grain in their backyard to artificially inflate the prices. I I guess you I suppose you could do that. Scott Bessant was trying to explain President Trump's tariffs on Sunday as well. He said the goal is to rebalance trade. It's completely consistent that the revenues come in at the beginning. Then as we rebalance, which is the goal of this, bring back high paid manufacturing jobs to the US, then it will then morph into",

You know, President Trump has consistently fought for the American worker and we are seeing trillions of investments in the US that would not have occurred without the tariffs. Well, you know, again, I have doubts and we'll find out if the American people feel the same way. It turns out that the classical economic thoughts about tariffs, in my view, tend to be correct and we'll see how this all pays off. Meanwhile, the media are indeed complete trash. They have been complete trash for a very long time. This became extraordinarily clear in I mean, this is really an amazing thing.

Apparently, that came after it was revealed that their flagship news program, Panorama, spaced together two separate clips of President Trump talking on January 6th, 2021, implying he had directly told his supporters to storm the capital, which of course is not true.

And he's saying that somehow this is targeting working people, which is an astonishing claim. I mean, just on a statistical level, it's an astonishing claim. The New York Times is trying to make excuses for all of this. His confidence is understandable. He's the first New York City mayoral candidate since John Lindseay to win over 1 million votes.

So, by the way, does Denmark, so does Norway. fully socialist countries would become countries like Cuba, North Korea.

There are a few takeaways. The the first takeaway obviously is that in offy-ear elections the out of party power the first lesson is that in offyear elections as we all know the party that is out of power tends to do very well because there's always a backlash against the governing party because all problems are now attributable to them. And there's no question that the government shutdown plays a part in this. Polls show that more Americans are blaming Republicans than Democrats for the government shutdown. They sort of blame both.

So, I think I think that that lesson that Republicans need some sort of positive message going forward, like a defense of the things that they're doing or at least an explanation of why government involvement isn't going to solve the problem.

Now, again, I don't think Americans like communism. I think that the reason that they say they like socialism is really because they don't know what socialism is because the definition has been futed. And second, because when people think of America, they think of capitalism. So, things are going badly, they don't like the status quo.

It just means the prices remain very high. And wage gains have not really eaten that into that yet. I mean, the prices of everything feel very expensive to people right now. And people are not wrong to feel that.

It's no good if we do a great job and you don't talk about it. >> Okay. Now he's not wrong about any of that. that there has never yet been a politician who tells people that their feelings about the economy are wrong who ends up doing well in a midterm. It just I remember when Barack Obama did this but people they just don't understand they just don't understand what I'm saying to I remember when he did that.

And it also happens to be true that people are just paying a lot more in groceries than they did even a couple of years ago. And when you go to the grocery store very often, you don't think about what you paid last year for groceries. You think what did I pay 5 years ago for groceries? And the answer is a lot less.

With that said, do people feel good about the price of groceries? The answer right now is no. They do not feel great about the price of groceries. In fact, I asked our sponsors over at Comet, a project of perplexity. How much does a week of groceries cost for an average American family compared to two years ago and and one year ago? So, according to Comet, for an average American family, the weekly grocery cost in 2025 is around 250 bucks to 270 bucks a week, which is slightly higher than the past 2 years due to continued food price inflation. In 2023 and 2024,",

However, if you ask Comet what was the average price of groceries for the same families in 2021, the grocery cost for a family of four range from about $146 to $289. So, if you take the low end of that estimate, you are talking about a 50% increase in the course of the last four years. And so, people continue to feel that. According to Comet, that number is about 20% increase in price. But if you're taking like the low end versus kind of the high end now you're talking about 40% increase 30 40 I mean these are major costs to families serious costs to",
ben_shapiro_ch1qmDW4A04_0471,ben_shapiro,ch1qmDW4A04,2759.76,2802.88,"families and so the question becomes what can government do about that? What can government do about that? Now it seems to me that there are a few things the government can do about that. Number one, the Federal Reserve's main mandate always should have been not to get to 2% annual inflation, but to get to 0% annual inflation. That should always have been the Federal Reserve's mission. It is ridiculous that the Federal Reserve always had a dual mission of keeping unemployment low and also keeping inflation low. It is not the job of the Federal Reserve to keep unemployment low. That means that they get to mess around with the money in order to manipulate the markets every every single day. And that is a problem. Senator Ran Paul is",

But beyond that, when people begin to have expectations of their government that are inaccurate, that the government can solve all your problems, you end up with actually bad policy. And this brings us to the tariff fight. President Trump wants to say that the tariffs that he has imposed are making life more affordable for Americans. He said that he he he continues to say that that tariff fight is making the American economy stronger. I see no evidence of this. I think at best you can say that the tariffs haven't wildly damaged America's economy yet and that is due to an enormous amount of investment capital that is being deployed particularly at the top end of the stock market. That is because",

Now, President Trump totally understands this with regard particularly to regulation and taxation. But when it comes to macroeconomic issues, things like subsidies or tariffs when it comes to quote unquote protecting certain sectors, he goes the wrong way on this. Now, I will say that there is something happening right now that counterintuitively could be very, very beneficial to the president. And so yesterday at the Supreme Court there was a hearing over whether President Trump has the emergency power to simply set global tariffs on every country up to including the penguins in the Solomon Islands. Does he actually have the ability to do that by claiming a national emergency? That was the question. And the hearing at the Supreme",

As the Wall Street Journal says, President Trump's global tariffs ran headlong into a skeptical Supreme Court on Wednesday, with justices across the spectrum expressing doubt that a 1970s emergency powers law could be read to provide the president unilateral authority to remake the international economy and collect billions of dollars in import taxes without explicit congressional approval. Even if the court strikes down the tariffs Trump initiated, the justices gave little indication how they might unwind the policy. I mean, well, no, actually, what the justice said is the tariffs would have to stop because they're not congressionally approved. The question is, what happens to the $90 billion or so of tax revenue that was taken in via the tariffs? Because tariffs are tax. How does that get refunded? And the answer is that it",

But Solicitor General John Sauer on behalf of the administration took heat from all sides as he pressed the administration's argument that the president's power to regulate foreign financial transactions when he declares an emergency includes the authority to impose tariffs. Now again the idea originally was that the president can regulate movement between territories that affect like terror groups for example. It wasn't that the president just gets to completely remake the economy by saying national emergency, not enough soybeans getting exported. Now we got to have a tariff. Tariffs are taxes.

Democrats are not lending the Republicans seven votes in order to get past the filibuster. And so, President Trump is calling for a thing that many Democrats have called for in the past and some Republicans, the nuking of the filibuster, the use of the so-called nuclear option, whereby you go to the Senate parliamentarian. You ask if the filibuster can basically be overruled and then with 51 votes, you pass a resolution in order to change the filibuster rules. The filibuster goes away and now for the rest of American history, 51 votes in the Senate will allow you to do anything. Now, I like the filibuster. I think the filibuster is good. Why do I like the filibuster? Because the Senate was supposed to be originally a deliberative body, which is where the deals got made. And one of the",

And so the proposal that I have made is on my proposal. My friend Jeremy Boring originally made this proposal and I think it's right. Republicans should say we want a constitutional amendment to enshrine the filibuster, the Senate legislative filibuster. We want a constitutional amendment to do that.

The New York Post reports today, quote, anti-Israel agitators who spread disruption at US colleges and were punished by authorities were awarded checks for $1,000 by a Muslim nonprofit, according to the New York Post.

On the same day that that story broke in the New York Post, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas announced that the Muslim Brotherhood and CARE would be designated as foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organizations under Texas penal and Texas property codes.

Whereas the Council on American Islamic Relations is an Islamist organization that according to the FBI was founded as a front group for Hamas and its support network in the United States.

That is not how the process works. By the way, it's in violation of American federal law. So Zor Mamani were to actually do that, he would be in violation of law.

It's not about the solutions. It's about tearing away at the system. That's the entire thing. Okay. Meanwhile, speaking of the Muslim Brotherhood, big controversy yesterday because the president of the United States hosted the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Muhammad bin Salman at the White House. And the media went nuts. They went nuts because back in 2018, there was a Washington Post journalist, and we say journalist, but he really was sort of an op-ed writer named Jamal Kashagi, who was absolutely Muslim Brotherhood linked. There's no question",
ben_shapiro_n_TgAa9uMVc_0525,ben_shapiro,n_TgAa9uMVc,1212.32,1255.52,"that Jamal Kashagi was linked with the Muslim Brotherhood. and he was murdered in grizzly fashion at the Saudi embassy in Turkey apparently at the Saudi consulate in Turkey according to intelligence estimates on the orders of Muhammad bin Salman. So the Biden administration decided to make this front and center in their campaign against Saudi because the Biden administration attempted to draw distance with the Saudi government in order to try and make overtures to the Iranian government. Saudis and the Iranians are enemies because the Iranians wish to destroy the Saudis and this has been true for a very long time. The Biden administration trying to draw closer to Iran cut a wedge between the United States and Saudi Arabia over the Kashagi murder. Now, no one is making the case that Kashagi should have been",
ben_shapiro_n_TgAa9uMVc_0526,ben_shapiro,n_TgAa9uMVc,1253.2,1298.0,"murdered by the Saudis. No one is making that case. It also happens to be the case that the United States has relations with a wide variety of various despotic regimes around the globe. Some are better for the American people, some are worse for the American people. And that's just the way the globe works. The vast majority of places on planet Earth are not nice places. And terrible things happen there and the leaders there do terrible things. That is a reality. And in fact, the real politique of the situation forced Joe Biden to basically go on bended knee to the Saudis to try and lower oil prices before the midterm elections in 2022. So he started off yelling at the Saudis about Jamal Kashagi and he ended by essentially bending the knee to the Saudis. Well, the media have decided",
ben_shapiro_n_TgAa9uMVc_0527,ben_shapiro,n_TgAa9uMVc,1296.72,1341.3600000000001,"that they're going to put tremendous focus on the Kashagi murder. For some reason, they seem to have no such objections to Qatari ties to Hamas, for example, or Qatari ties to Iran, which is responsible for the death and wounding. Iran is, of course, responsible for the death and wounding of of hundreds of Americans during the Iraq war. They seem to have no such complaints. Whenever Erdogan visits from Turkey, Erdogan has participated in extraordinary variety of human rights abuses. But when NBS shows up, then it's time to ask him endlessly about Jamal Kashagi. Again, he can answer those questions. That's that's his problem. But I will note the outsized interest in Jamaal Kashagi as opposed to all the other various human",
ben_shapiro_n_TgAa9uMVc_0528,ben_shapiro,n_TgAa9uMVc,1340.24,1384.96,rights violations that are happening around the region has more to do with the legacy media's geopolitics in which they they don't like Saudi because they believe that there ought to be some sort of Obama-esque balance of power benefiting maybe the Turks and Iran at the expense of the Saudis and the Israelis presumably. That's why the focus on Jamal Kashagi because again if you look at the history of Jamal Kashagi the attempt to paint him as some sort of liberal reformer again no one's making the case he should have been murdered but we should at least be accurate about who Jamal Kashagi was. As the Jerusalem Post reported in a piece by Rosman back in 2024 Jamal Kashagi was deeply associated with,
ben_shapiro_n_TgAa9uMVc_0529,ben_shapiro,n_TgAa9uMVc,1382.96,1425.36,"the Muslim Brotherhood. In the months leading up to his death, he was in the process of launching an organization known as Dawn Democracy for the Arab world now working in close collaboration with Nihadawad, executive director and co-founder of K and a board member of Dawn. Now again, K is deeply associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. They have close personal ties in the form of some of their leadership with people who are associated with kamas for sure. So Kashagi had a lot of those connections. You can say two things at once. One, he shouldn't have been murdered. Two, Jamaal Kashagi was not a liberal reformer in the Arab world. That is not what he was. In any case, the media",
ben_shapiro_n_TgAa9uMVc_0530,ben_shapiro,n_TgAa9uMVc,1424.0,1468.3200000000002,"decided that they were going to ask the president about MBS and Kashagi. The proper answer from the president here probably was something like the murder of Jamaal Kashagi was a tragic problem. It obviously is is something we don't like here. Also, we are in the business of geopolitics and pursuing America's interests. Right. That's the actual answer here. The president tries to do something like that, ends up defending NBS from the charges. >> He's done a phenomenal job. You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen. But he knew nothing about it. And we can leave it at that. You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.",

However, what he is saying which is that NBS is a transformative leader in the region and that the United States needs to work with the people who are there. We don't get to choose the leadership class in all these countries that is accurate and again the media attention with regard to all of this I think is quite purposeful. I do not think that it is a coincidence. They'd rather the virtue signaling about Jamaal Kashagi than the reality of actual geopolitics which involves having to deal on a pretty regular basis with some of the worst people on planet Earth.

Now, speaking of Trump derangement syndrome, all of the controversy swirling around Jeffrey Epstein continues. is the Senate yesterday approved the Epstein files bill sending it to President Trump's desk. Now, as we discussed, the bill doesn't actually do anything. The bill has a provision that allows the DOJ and actually suggest that the DOJ must redact anything that would violate the law in releasing, which is already the",
ben_shapiro_n_TgAa9uMVc_0539,ben_shapiro,n_TgAa9uMVc,1808.24,1852.559,"case. I mean, the Trump administration has already filed lawsuits in order to get courts to release information. The courts say, ""We can't release that information. can't let you release grand jury information, for example, because that violates actual law and implicates people who are not even alleged to have committed a crime. However, this whole thing was political. It was always political. The people who are leading the charge on this, as we mentioned yesterday, many of them are people who are directly involved with Jeffrey Epstein. That includes people like Steve Bannon on the right, people like Stacy Plaset on the left. I mean yesterday, for example, James Comr exposed the fact that Hakee Jeff, the House Minority Leader, had solicited a meeting with Jeffrey Epstein in 2013.",

Another email shows Democrat fundraisers invited Epste to an event or to meet privately with Hakee Jeff as part of their 2013 effort to to build to win a majority. So, Hakeem Jeff campaign solicited money from Jeffrey Epstein. So, again, the Epstein scandal is a real scandal and they remain open questions and I will continue to maintain that those those questions are open.

Does he have any idea what's being covered up? Like, really, what is the big cover up? >> We want the whole truth to come out. This is the United States of America.

So Larry Summers has been on the chopping block, but if you think that President Trump is in any way endangered here, that's that's quite silly. Speaker Johnson pointed out that all of this is about trying to weaponize Epstein against Trump.

Apparently, AI companies account for 80% of the gains in US stocks this year. So, is this a bubble? Well, says Neil Ferguson, 19th century railroads may be a better analogy to AI than 1990s telecoms.

Obamacare relies on these subsidies because Obamacare itself is kind of a bleep show. Very few people are ever going to reach their full deductible under Obamacare. They're just going to pay in tens of thousands of dollars to these Obamacare systems. Many doctors don't even take Obamacare. So, you don't get the doctor that you want. You're paying too much money. Unless you have the federal government subsidizing you. It was always a backdoor nationalization of the healthare system scheme, Obamacare. And when Republicans say no, Democrats complain. They created the system, but somehow it's Republicans who are to blame. Well, President Trump celebrated the end of the shutdown yesterday. Here",

I think based on everything I'm hearing, they haven't changed anything and we have support from enough Democrats and we're going to be opening up our country. It's too bad it was closed, but we'll be opening up our country very quickly. >> Yesterday, the president put out a statement about air traffic controllers who are not showing up to work because presumably they're not being paid. Maybe they're afraid they won't get paid. He said all air traffic controllers must get back to work now. Anyone who doesn't will be substantially docked.

I I see no reason why the taxpayer should should be on the dime for airports which are eminently privatizable. You could absolutely privatize the airports. You could have airlines chip in for their own security and work with a system together to ensure the planes don't hit each other in the sky. In any case, that's that's another issue.

Democrats are stuck between a rock and a hard place because basically the only concession they got from Republicans was a commitment to do a vote on Obamacare subsidies. They will lose that vote, by the way. And that was offered by John Thun very early on in the shutdown actually. So now Dick Durban, Senate Minority Leaders deputy, he's the number two in the Senate for the Democrats. He's out there saying the GOP must keep their word. Well, the GOP can keep their word and they can still win. >> I've served in the Senate for 29 years, and I've never seen that kind of offer from a Senate majority.

He's trying to claim that now they'll really be able to split put the screws to the Republicans on more Obamacare subsidies. >> So now we're going to pay federal workers.

I think it's a fight we can win. >> Now again, Democrats don't even believe this, so they are ticked. They are really ticked, especially those who have 2028 aspirations. According to Axios, many congressional Democrats are not on board with that Senate deal. Democrats are once again divided. The shutdown deal didn't extend healthcare subsidies. Of course, the Senate ultimately settled for nothing more than a promise of a vote. They got an extension of government funding through January 30th, funding for food stamps through fiscal year 2026 and the reversal of those federal worker layoffs that President Trump had done during the shutdown.",

And basically his popularity rests on his policies never being dried. Here here is Bernie Sanders yelling at the shutdown being ended. >> Look, I think it was a terrible, terrible vote. Uh at a time when we have a broken health care system, this is going to make our healthcare system even worse. And that vote last night paves the way for 15 million people to be thrown off Medicaid.

Speaking of Medicaid and healthcare outcomes, I asked our sponsors at Comet, a new web browser by Perplexity, aren't their studies suggesting Medicaid has not actually improved healthcare outcomes? And what Comet says is mixed findings from research. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment found Medicaid improved self-reported health and reduced depression, but did not show statistically significant improvements in key clinical outcomes like blood pressure, blood sugar control, or cholesterol levels. Some long-term analyses suggest Medicaid expansion produced temporary gains in self-reported and mental health, but these improvements diminished over several years, leading to little durable difference in direct health metrics",

So again, the question of whether Medicaid has actually translated into sustained improvement in physical health, that is a very hot topic. There is no clear evidence that it does. Yeah, this is not an argument Medicaid shouldn't exist, but the idea that Medicaid as a general proposition has been wildly beneficial to the health of Americans is unsubstantiated by the actual data. When Bernie Sanders keeps saying things like tens of thousands will die, that is precisely the sort of catastrophic language that leads to people, you know, chanting Bernie Sanders slogan while they shoot up congressional baseball games in Virginia.

And she is very much afraid that if she does what Zoran Mamani wants, it'll absolutely crater her gubernatorial chances in her re-elect effort.

He said, ""I continue to be excited at the work of making the slowest buses in America fast and free. And I appreciate the governor's continued partnership and delivering on that agenda of affordability.""

And apparently one of the reasons that Jacob Frey won is that he actually identified inside the Somali community clans that didn't like other clans and then proceeded to target them for voting which led Elhan Omar another person elected by the Somali community to suggest that Somali who didn't support her or Fate should be expelled. I mean, you want to talk about tribal politics happening inside Democratic party, here we go. She says, ""When a Somalian person becomes an enemy, they become a serious one.

The reason that Marjgerie Taylor Green is doing this is not because she has lost her way. It's because she has found her way and her way is to undermine President Trump's coalition on behalf of her own parochial interests. That is what she is doing.

Again, there are rumors that she wants to run for president, to which I say absolutely she should. And we'll find out how popular her program is. I would suggest not all that popular. Okay. Meanwhile, the president continues to be battered around on on issues of affordability because affordability of course is the word of the day. And yes, Americans are deeply concerned about affordability. As the New York Times points out, President Trump has mentioned the word affordability as much in the last week as he has in the past nine months. His",

So, Democrats have been trying to make the case that President Trump is not paying attention to affordability. President Trump has fought back by claiming that inflation is way down under his presidency, which of course is true, is way up under Joe Biden. It is reduced, but it has not ended by any stretch of the imagination. A Washington Post ABC News Ipsos poll recently found that a majority of Americans say they are currently spending more on groceries and utilities than they were a year ago. Only 30% of voters believe President Trump has lived up to their expectations for tackling inflation and the cost of living. And of course, it is Marjgerie Taylor Green",
ben_shapiro_k4g4vpR4EaM_0620,ben_shapiro,k4g4vpR4EaM,2133.2,2175.68,"who's leading the charge, not because she cares about affordability, but because she wishes again to attack the president. She said, ""I go to the grocery store myself. Groceries prices remain high. Energy prices are high. My electricity bills are higher here at Washington DC at my apartment. They're also higher at my house in Rome, Georgia, higher than they were a year ago. Now again, the ways that you actually bring affordability into view, freer trade, less regulation, lower taxes, that makes things more affordable. But the president again seems very wedded to his tariff regimen. And and the tariffs are not particularly hitting tech. Okay, tech because tech is transnational and it is less wedded to location than many other businesses in",

They don't hit Tesla in the same way because Tesla's valuation is not as much predicated on the number of cars that it sells as it is on the expectation that that Elon Musk is using all the data that he's gathering to build new types of robotics and new types of AI. So what does that mean? means all the gains are going to the tech companies at the top of the market and all the sort of mainstream American companies that actually rely on inputs and then being able to export. Those are the ones that are being hurt. Nonetheless, President Trump is out there warning of a national security disaster if the Supreme Court shoots down the tariffs.

It would be a national security disaster if we lost the case in the Supreme Court. >> Okay. Now I think the markets would react a very different way than President Trump suggests. If the Supreme Court were to strike down the tariffs, yeah, there would be another round of uncertainty, but at least the president wouldn't be able to sort of just blanket tariff the entire world.

So, the Supreme Court has now rejected a call to overturn Oersfeld. Oberersfeld, of course, is the Supreme Court case that established essentially a national right to samesex marriage. That case is wrongly decided. It is an egregious violation of the constitutional text. But the Supreme Court did not want to take it up. That is not a surprise. Even in the DOS case, which overthrew Row versus Wade, there was a footnote from Justice Kavanaaugh in which he explicitly said basically, ""We're not going to take up Oberfeld.""

That entire concept is also the basis for the idea that there is a right to samesex marriage implicit in the Constitution of the United States which is totally insane. There is no such right implicit in the Constitution of the United States. Now, that does not mean that on a public policy level that there should be laws against gay people living together or people doing what they want in the privacy of their own homes.

That is not a particular shock since samesex marriage has been embedded into the fabric of the society for 10 years and probably 20 if you go back to Massachusetts starting to perform these sorts of marriages. Her lawyers, the lawyers for Kim Davis are the ones who sued. She of course was the former Kentucky court clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to samesex couples after that 2015 ruling in Oberfell. She had been trying to get the court to overturn a lower court order for her to pay $360,000 in damages and attorney's fees. So, a couple denied a marriage license. Her lawyers repeatedly invoked the words of Justice Clarence Thomas, who has called for erasing the samesex marriage",
ben_shapiro_k4g4vpR4EaM_0626,ben_shapiro,k4g4vpR4EaM,2381.92,2425.1189999999997,"ruling on the basis of, you know, the thing called the Constitution. So again, there's probably some support on the court for overthrowing Oberfeld, but certainly not enough. For example, Justice Amy Coney Barrett has said that samesex marriage might not be in the same sort of category with regard to right to privacy as abortion because people have relied on the decision when they married and then had kids. And the bottom line here is that again the the chances the Supreme Court was going to touch this were always extremely extremely low. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is poised to hear a major challenge to mailin ballot laws. According to the New York Times, they will hear a challenge to Mississippi's counting of mail-in",

So, first of all, if you mail in your ballot and it is received after election day, tough luck. This is ridiculous. Th this notion, first of all, that we should be doing vast mail-in balloting in the United States weeks in advance of an election is totally crazy. It used to be called election day. It is now election season. And if you waited until election day to mail your ballot because you were too lazy to go to a polling place and then it's received 3 days later, tough luck. There are lots of reasons we invalidate ballots in this country. You mark them improperly. You wrote your name down wrong. Like there are lots of reasons why your ballot might not count. If you don't abide by the rules, then that is what it is. If you don't abide by the rules, I'm not sure why the rules",

That's silly. because otherwise you are opening the door to widespread voter intimidation and voter fraud. The case is a potential blockbuster according to the New York Times that asks the justices to determine the meaning of election day. The challenge to the Mississippi law reflects political fights over the increased use of mail-in ballots which exploded during the COVID pandemic. In 2024, the RNC along with the Mississippi Republican Party and individual voters challenged Mississippi's mail-in ballot rules. The challengers argued Congress had intended voting take place on a single election day and allowing ballots to arrive days later and still be counted undermined election integrity and the public's trust in the vote. I mean, obviously that's true. Obviously, that's true. Now, again, they they're claiming that",

The problem is, do you want your elections to carry on for days on end? Is that a thing that we want to incentivize? And the answer there is pretty clearly no. And meanwhile, on the foreign policy front, we have now been treated to the bizarre spectacle of a terrorist who put on a suit, and now we're supposed to pretend that he's no longer a terrorist in any way. I understand that relations with Syria are complex after the fall of Bashar Assad, which again, I said at the time was going to open a huge number of problems as well as the possibility of future opportunities. Well, both those things have been true. The person who",

Syria, the United States is trying to broker some sort of deal between Syria and Israel. The Turks basically run Syria at this point. The great unmentioned elephant in the room in the Middle East right now is not Iran. It's not Israel. It's not Saudi. It's Turkey. Turkey has been spreading its wings attempting to extend the range of its neotoman empire through Syria. There's no question that's what Turkey has been doing. Erdogan is in fact a radical Islamist who supports terrorism throughout the region. The fact that",

And so the matter in Syria has become complicated because militias largely backed by the Syrian government or at least with the Syrian government looking the other way. Those militias have been going in and slaughtering Drews in the south of Syria. The state of Israel which of course has large Drews population has been attempting to defend the Drews because the Drews again being quite tribal are willing to literally walk over the border to Syria and just start fighting on behalf of their brothers. And so things are pretty complicated over in Syria. With that said, there are possible possible openings in Syria if the United States is willing to tell the Turks to back down. According to the Wall Street Journal, Syria has now",

The decision is a sign of Syria's transition from a driver of Middle East instability as a result of former President Bashar al-Assad's violent crackdown on his own people, which allowed ISIS to flourish into an ally, aiding an Americanled military operation to keep ISIS at bay. There's talk about opening embassies in the capital of Damascus or Syria, reopening its embassy in Washington, DC. And the president met with this person who again was a terrorist and has terrorist sympathies. Can he be turned around? We're going to find out in very, very short order.

Well, I mean, again, that is treating Turkey, I think, with a little more respect than Turkey deserves at this point, given its support for, again, Kamas in the Gaza Strip and its openly Islamist attempts to turn its regime from a secularist regime into a Sharia regime under Erdogan.

And meanwhile, in a piece of salutoy news, the IOC has now decided to ban transgender women, meaning men, from all female Olympic events. That would be the International Olympic Committee. This has become, of course, a very hot issue given the fact that last time at the Olympics, men were fighting women in boxing. According to the New York Post, the International Olympic Committee is reportedly set to ban trans women from competing in all female categories. The change is set to be officially announced early next year. The decision to overhaul the current policy was made after the sporting committee carried out",

It is unbelievable that it took an entire cultural revolution in the United States in order to say what is perfectly obvious. Again, that's sort of the way that things work here in the United States these days is that saying the perfectly obvious has now become a matter of serious controversy.

And so the fact that everyone's flattering momi by saying well you know he he did talk a lot about affordability. And what I keep saying to people is well affordability is not like Beetlejuice where if you just say it over and over it suddenly arrives. You actually have to pursue policies that are likely to alleviate an affordability problem. But if your solution is always give me more power and it does seem like that is the solution of the day from both sides actually uh then you're likely to just continue penduluming one side to the other because people don't",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0676,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,172.0,215.2,"want to learn the actual lesson which is if you if you actually want affordability then either you have to change policies or change locations. Those are really the only two things and and also I think more broadly it's not about affordability. We have trained an entire generation of people to believe that if their lives are not what they want them to be, it's the fault of systems as opposed to decisions that are in their own control. And politicians absolutely have a stake in selling that. A lot of people in our industry have a stake in in selling that. Makes people feel good about themselves and bad about the world. And the reality is if you want a better life, you should feel better about the world and worse about yourself until you actually, you know, go do the right things. >> I I broadly, generally speaking, as a matter of principle, agree with you. But I mean, I was looking around at property",

I feel kind of poor looking at those things. >> Oh, no. It's unaf and I'm not saying it's not affordable. It absolutely is unaffordable. And if you wanted to make a political difference, what you would do is you would relieve the building regulations. You would you would make it easier for people to build, not harder. You wouldn't rent control because if you stop rent controlling, then that creates incentive for people to build. You would allow people to build up further. you would get rid of of many of the the code regulations that are kind of antiquated. Like there there are things you actually could do. And then if you're a young person and you can't afford to live here, then maybe you should not live here. I mean, that is a real thing. Okay? I know that we we've now grown up in a society that says that you deserve to live where you grew up, but the reality is that the history of America",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0678,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,253.76,297.6,"is almost literally the opposite of that. The history of America is you go to a place where there is opportunity. And if the opportunities are limited here and they're not changing, then you really should try to think about other places where you have better opportunities. Again, that's not saying that public policy can't change. I think it can. But I think that the solutions being offered are are untenable. >> Well, I sort of see the the problem with what you're saying is that really doesn't sound nearly as good as free stuff. >> Correct. Correct. The the third grade presidential campaign continues to win. It's undefeated, right? free ice cream, free busing, free child care, and free money paid for by somebody else.

ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0680,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,336.96,381.52,things I find really amusing about Mam Donnie uh in kind of a cynical way is is when he does this the coalition of the dispossessed we're all going to come together those of us with the bruised knuckles and it's like my dude you haven't held a real job your entire life your entire life I have a more successful rap career than Zoron Mani and I'm not even joking that's true right like Zoran Mamani is a failed rapper he was a he was a person who didn't hold a real job he got elected to the assembly and ditched half of his votes and now he's mayor of New York having grown up in the lap of luxury in a country to which his parents immigrate like he's been given the best of America and his solution is America sucks and is terrible and so now I'm going to quote Eugene Debs and NU in my in my inauguration speech in my in my in my victory speech which is which is what he,
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0681,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,379.44,424.40000000000003,did which you know again that's that's a take but it it just underscores one of the sort of fascinating things about revolutionary movements is they are very rarely led by members of the proletariat they're very often led by I I would say unsatisfied members of the bgeoisi who then decide they must be the vanguard of the proletarian area >> and it's so interesting the young people's obsession with socialism having seen socialism be implemented in Venezuela and then it being championed in lionized by particularly people of the British left the Jeremy Corbyn of the world etc etc and I've given up trying to explain the evils of socialism and communism to young people because I had a friend a Cuban friend who said Francis it's like a magic trick and,
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0682,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,422.08,465.759,"until you see the reveal you ain't going to get the trick And you need to see the reveal. And that's kind of what it's like, isn't it? >> I think that's right. Because it's so unthinkable. Like if you say to people, well, look at Venezuela. Say, well, it's not going to be like Venezuela here. Are you kidding? Like, how? Like, how? And and the reality is it happens pretty suddenly. It's like the the the transition from, you know, democratic capitalism to socialism, it does happen very quickly. I mean, once once the government has the power to do these things, they they do implement them very fast. And so, what was unthinkable becomes suddenly just reality. And so most Americans also don't understand how it is that we became wealthy. They don't understand how we became a very prosperous country. They tend to think that how things are is the natural state",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0683,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,463.28,508.24,"of being. That wealth and prosperity and the nice things we have and these great new products every year and being able to order things on Amazon. Like that's why, you know, the one of my favorite comedy routines is Louis C. Kay has this whole comedy routine about people complaining about flying in planes. He's like, you know, we're all complaining. Oh, it's just terrible the conditions. Like your grandparents would have had to travel for 3 months to get from point A to point B and you're doing it in 6 hours in a magical machine that flies in the sky and you're sitting here complaining about that and that's but that's kind of human nature. It's what you see in your daily life is what you accept as the norm. And we do have these things called you know airplanes that actively are time machines. You can fly to other places on Earth that don't have the things that we have and you can look at the systems they've implemented and you can see why they don't have those things. But everybody who's growing up,",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0684,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,507.199,551.04,"you know, listen, we're a spoiled society. Everybody who's been growing up, you know, with all of this nice stuff, we think that that's the norm and that there's no way that that norm is ever going to go away. And that's not true. >> Well, look, I again, I agree with you broadly in principle. However, when you talk about your grandparents, yes, our grandparents would be amazed by the smartphone and all all of the other things you talk about, but our grandparents also could raise a family of four in a single income, have a house, have a car, and have a middle class life. So it's so I think there there are a few things that are that are slightly a misnomer about that. So I think that number one your your grandparents depending on when they grew up in say the 30s actually couldn't I mean your your grandparents were dirt poor if they grew up in in the great depression in the 1930s that was a very very bad decade and then if they lived",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0685,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,548.72,592.16,"from 1941 to 45 in this country then your grandfather was likely to be being shot at in in either Europe or the Pacific. So those are rough years you know turning those into sort of the golden age of what it was like to live in. So when people talk about this, what they're really talking about is a fairly short period of American history that existed essentially between the end of World War II and economically the rise of the rest of the world when the rest of the world was basically in ruins. And so America could send a bunch of money to Europe and then produce all the products here because literally there was no industrial base anywhere else on planet Earth. They'd all been destroyed by World War II. And then you could work one income and you could still do that. That was actually not the way that virtually all work was done in the United States ever. I mean, if you go back to the 1910s and 1900s when this",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0686,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,589.92,634.8,"was largely an agricultural society, mom was working on the farm, right? And and when you're talking about problems of, for example, industrial labor, women were were working in factories. And so this kind of brief period in American history, which was actually sort of a an outlier in terms of all world history and and treating that as like the norm, is not true. Second of all, the the housing affordability crisis, the average house in the United States is significantly nicer, significantly larger with central air. If you looked at the house that your grandparents were living in in 1952, you would say, ""This place is box. This place is is bad."" Uh, and and if you look at the job that your grandparents were working in 1953 at the Ford factory, you sitting in your comfortable office, your air conditioned office, you know, complaining about your sciatica from your uncomfortable office",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0687,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,633.519,678.0790000000001,"chair, and then you're like, ""Oh man, I'm I'm really longing for those days of rivet riveting."" That is not an easy job. And and by the way, it's not because we shipped it overseas because machines do it now. >> And so like the again, this is not to say everything is perfect because it isn't. But I think that having a false picture of the economic past leads to bad conclusions about the economic present that are not supportable by the actual by the actual data. >> Well, you make good points. I guess what I'm saying as well is like if you look at the other candidates in this election that Manish just won, you did not have the same level of speaking to people's concerns about some of those issues. >> I agree. I mean the empathy sells in politics and also makes for very bad policy. Uh because as as many people",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0688,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,674.959,719.839,"have noted, empathy is is about the person in front of you and feeling what that person feels. And that's great politically, right? I mean that's that's that's what makes people magic in a room. But when it comes to making a broad public policy, then it's really what is the most effective policy for the greatest number of people. And and if you get empathetic about like this individual, you're very likely to make a bad policy that is specifically designated to help this individual at the expense of many other individuals because anybody who says they're empathetic toward all humanity is is lying. I mean, that's that's that's usually not true. You're empathetic toward others. You're like, it's it's a little it's a little selferving. And so, again, I'll give Manzani credit for magically shaking the hands of cab drivers and kissing babies and being very very good at that. Um, but I'm not sure why that makes for good policy in",

And I'm like, can we just not accept that as a campaign politician, he is 100% undeniable. He >> he's he's he's terrific, particularly in shorts. So I think the debates the the last couple debates I didn't think that he did great because they're you know he was asked questions and he really couldn't defend himself but I don't think debates matter anymore because that's not how anybody consumes information right the podcast space may be the last space where people consume in long form information and even there it's clips from the show that are going to go viral on X right and so if you're Zoram Donnie and you're and you put on you know what I think is kind of a a",

ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0693,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,884.079,926.0,exploded last week in particular over the fact that Tucker Carlson had this white nationalist called Nick Fuentes on a show. Uh and then there is a big debate now going on in which you're one of the participants about whether the right should turn a blind eye to the fact that its fringe is in becoming increasingly Naziish or whether there's a break that needs to be made to prevent what happened on the woke left or rather because of the woke left on the left where the extremists took over wore the skin of the entire thing and then were punished very severely electorally over a period of time. uh give us your perspective on on that. >> Sure.

I think that that last week was a a pretty good sort of indicator that that there is a bleed over from a series of terrible ideas into the more mainstream area. The problem is not of course that that Tucker Carl it's a it's a free country. He can interview whomever he damn well pleases.

I mean he treated him with kid gloves. He did not ask him a single difficult question.

And and I also think that, you know, there is an attempt to not only pretend it away, but in some cases embrace it with this sort of no enemies to my right or our coalition, our coalition must stand together or we'll lose. And I think that's bad pragmatically. I don't think that's even true. I think that what we've watched here is yeah, everybody's celebrating Zaram Donnie winning in New York.

I don't think those laundered views are particularly popular with the American people and so if the right wants to pretend like you know moving in that direction is going to win them additional votes not the number of votes you're going to lose by moving in this particular direction.

I'm not calling Tucker an ambulatory psychotic. I think he's very actually coherent in what he's doing. Um, but the I know a lot of people who have a big audience. We should note that every big audience in the media, you're talking about three four million people. The electorate in the United States is generally about 160 million people. And so you can find, you know, you can it's a big country. You can find a niche for for anything. I think one of the mistakes politicians make is they look at X and they say this is representative of the American body politic. And that is just too online. It's just way too online.

Uh, and I think that's good. But I but I do agree that one of the polar polarized aspects of American politics is this idea that as long as you're quoteunquote on my side, we don't actually define what on my side means based on say principle. We instead define it based on what we supposedly oppose, but even then we don't necessarily oppose the same things, but we kind of broadly just throw up our hands. They're on my side.",

And I think that if you if you lose your soul, then you end up losing the country. Again, the things that I've fought for, let's put it this way. I've been doing this for a very long time. I started writing a syndicated column when I was 17 years old. I don't know that there's anybody who's been following me for any period of time who's ever said I whatever happened to the views that bench. He's really morphed. He's really changed. Well, what what happened? Like I don't get that question ever, but I don't think you can say the same about Tucker. I mean, I think that's one of the most common questions about Tucker.",

I mean, listen, at the Daily Wire, we have a wide variety of views on a wide variety of of subjects. Um, you know, Matt Matt is free to have his opinion. I think he's wrong. I'm sure he thinks I'm wrong and and that is what it is. I also noticed that Matt is not glossing. Nick does.",

We would treat him very differently, I think, than Tucker would. we would have a conversation with him and push on on some of the things that he's said. We haven't heard anything back. But where does this idea come from that if I say the person you had on your show is someone whose values I don't agree with and I don't like the way you conducted the interview, that is cancellation. >> Yeah. I mean, when did that happen? >> I think it's a it's a really lowresolution response to what probably was a lowresolution description of cancellation in the first place. I think that if you were going to look at sort of the etmology of of what happened",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0705,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,1384.0,1428.64,"here, it seems to me that the left shut the Overton window so unbelievably tight that if you said, for example, a man is not a woman, this meant that you had to be socially ostracized. And I think that's what people mean when they say cancellation. Cancel the free speech concerns typically are about being banned from from platforms. Cancellation is the idea of social ostracism that you must be invited to the party. And and so for a while it was like you couldn't be invited to any party or people would attempt to go after your career if you said things that were kind of baseline normaly and and the response on the right was not let's let's broaden the overton window. It was let's eviscerate the overton window. Now all almost a morally relativistic response. All views are now to be treated as perfectly equivalent. And if you act with scorn at",

And and so what you end up with is this sort of bizarre this bizarre math where the the right has taken to the idea that if you get a lot of flack, it's because you're over the target. >> And also that if you criticize, then that's a form of cancellation. That that's a form of social ostracization. Well, if you add those two things together, what you come up with is it is probably better to be a Nazi than to criticize a Nazi. Because if you're a Nazi, then you're taking a lot of flack, which must mean that you're over the target. And if someone criticizes you, then they're engaging in the same sort of politically correct cancellation that the left was engaging in. You must be right. They must be wrong.

ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0707,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,1469.12,1512.0,"principles. So I think that's a really low resolution view. I think the the argument about cancellation was not that nobody should ever be socially ostracized. It was that the the idea set that was being socially ostracized was a very normie mainstream set of views. And I'm not a moral relativist. I don't believe all views are equivalently moral or decent or or worthy of or even worthy of response. I think this idea that you're not allowed to have scorn for views that you believe are damaging or deeply immoral, like truly bad. Like for example, I don't even not even arguments, just statements. Like, you know, Nick V is calling JD JD Vance's wife a jet. Like that's not an argument. Or that J or like how are you supposed to respond to the argument that that he",
ben_shapiro_-v01asSN2gU_0708,ben_shapiro,-v01asSN2gU,1509.2,1553.52,"has made, for example, that JD Vance is a fat gay race trader who shouldn't be president of the United States because he's in an intermarriage. Am I allowed to respond to SC? I feel like scorn is a pretty good response to that and that that doesn't actually deserve a debate or a wholesome discussion and that in fact treating that as though that is a rational idea is a disservice to rationality. >> But if you treat all forms of that response as cancellation, that's probably how you get to this math. >> And of course, one of the other things that happened and I think the woke left deserves all the scorn and blame for this is what they've done to words. I see people now saying, ""Well, how dare you call Nick Fuentes Nazi?"" I'm go, ""Well, it's I'm not insulting him. I am describing his views. >> Correct. I mean, there's been an attempt because the left has overused all of",

And that means that when you do that in the rhetorical space, you actually end up destroying the systemic immunity that people have to bad things. Exactly. So, if you if you call everything racist, then the response typically is, okay, nothing's racist. But that's not true. We know that some things are actually racist. If you say that that black people are innately inferior, that's racist, right? That's a that's a racist statement. But if I say racist, there's a group of people who will immediately say, well, no, you're just using racist as a club in order to shut down conversation because the left used it in that way. And and so a sort of Pavlovian response is developed where if you use a term the way it's properly supposed to be used, then it's treated the same as if you were improperly using the terms. The term itself loses all meaning. And then you know, I guess what",

And then there are jokes that are designed to legitimately tear other people down and and harm them. And and they're not all quite the same.

Open AI is not publicly traded but you have a bunch of publicly traded companies that are basically doing circular cash deals with open AI.

It does not mean that the fundamentals seem particularly strong to me. Why? Well, again, because so much of what is happening at the top end of the market, and the vast majority of the gains in the stock market are located in the Magnificent 7 in those top seven companies, the rest of the stock market over the past couple years has been essentially flat, maybe slight increase.

So, back in October, there's a piece from the New York Times that explained how much money is passing hands between companies like, for example, Open AI and companies like Nvidia. According to the New York Times, Sam Ultman, the chief executive of Open AI, says technological revolutions are driven by more than technology. They're driven by new ways of paying for them. He recently said, ""There is always a lot of focus on technological innovation. What really drives a lot of progress is when people also figure out how to innovate on the financial model."" Now, that's true. I mean, new financial tools do unlock new capacities for liquidity.",

Over the last several years, as the New York Times points out, Mr. Altman's company has found unusual and creative ways of paying for the computing power needed to fuel its ambitions. Many of the deals Open AI has struck with chipmakers, cloud computing companies, and others are strangely circular. Open AI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services. So for example, from 2019 through 2023, Microsoft was OpenAI's primary investor. Microsoft pumped more than 13 billion into the startup and then OpenAI funneled most of those billions back",
ben_shapiro_M1A2BO4tkhE_0754,ben_shapiro,M1A2BO4tkhE,379.199,423.599,"into Microsoft, buying cloud computing power needed to fuel the development of new AI technologies. By the summer of last year, OpenAI could not get all the computing power they wanted from Microsoft. So, they started signing cloud computing contracts with other companies, including Oracle and littleknown startups with names like Coreweave. Across three different deals signed this year, OpenAI agreed to pay Coree, a company that builds AI data centers, more than $22 billion for computing power. As part of these agreements, OpenAI received $350 million in Coree stock, which could ultimately help pay for this computing power. OpenAI struggled to get additional investment from Microsoft. So instead, it went to SoftBank, which then lent it $40 billion.",
ben_shapiro_M1A2BO4tkhE_0755,ben_shapiro,M1A2BO4tkhE,422.08,465.52000000000004,"At the same time, OpenAI has been working with various companies to build its own computing data centers. Rather than relying on cloud computing deals, and that includes Soft Bank, so the company is raising hundred billion to help OpenAI build data centers in Texas and Ohio. Oracle has agreed to spend $300 billion building new data centers for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Open AAI will then pay Oracle roughly the same amount to use these computing facilities over the next several years. So again, there's a lot of circular money movement right here. Last month, Nvidia announced it intends to invest $und00 billion in OpenAI over the next several years, which will help OpenAI pay for its new data sensors. And",
ben_shapiro_M1A2BO4tkhE_0756,ben_shapiro,M1A2BO4tkhE,463.36,506.4,"then OpenAI will use that money to buy chips from Nvidia. So again, there's nothing particularly corrupt about all of this, but it's everybody betting on the same horses over and over and over and over. If you keep betting on the same horses over and over and over, and those horses don't come in, things get ugly. What happens if OpenAI does not deliver the gains it is promised to everybody? Well, it's not going to be able to pay for all of those bills. It's not going to be able to pay Oracle or Nvidia or any of the other companies that have bet on it. In fact, according to Barrens, Oracle stock has given back all the gains from the cloud computing group Nvidia Moment as investors grow increasingly cautious over investments linked to the AI boom and shares just keep falling. When Oracle reported earnings in September,",

That forecast has become a source of consternation due to the source of that revenue, OpenAI, which plans to spend 1.4 trillion building and accessing AI data centers over the next decade. In fact, Oracle is also trading at least in part as a proxy for OpenAI. Remember, OpenAI is a private company. What does that mean? It means you and I, we can't buy stock in Open AI. The only companies that are buying stock from OpenAI are making private deals for Open AI. Okay? But it is not publicly traded. So, we don't know its actual real market valuation at this point. And again, are the gains to Open AI, the profits to OpenAI going to acrue to a multiple of seven or 10 or 15 from where",

And that would have to happen pretty fast. One of its biggest commitments is a reported $300 billion agreement to buy computing power for Oracle. That deal represented about 65% of its so-called RPO forecast that sent the stock soaring in early September. But a lot has happened since then. Oracle tapped the corporate bond market for an $18 billion debt sale that triggered a wave of new issues from tech giants like Meta. Private credit markets wobbled following a spate of autorelated bankruptcies and broader market liquidity dried up. So again, one of the reasons why they're going to need market liquidity is to make these sorts of deals.",

But the reality is that the people who are the sophisticated investors are saying I'm going to get out while getting is good at least at the top end of the market. Now again, I'm not saying that a stock market crash is imminent. I'm saying that there is a bubble. It seems to me in a lot of areas, in real estate, there's a bubble. In tech, there is a bubble. And when you have a market that is this frothy, the possibility of bubbles bursting is pretty robust. That doesn't mean recession or depression, but it does mean the possibility of stagnation since, again, so much economic growth right now is predicated on tech.

The Wall Street Investment Bank said that strategy has paid off handsomely as the S&P 500 reached multiple all-time highs this year. Now, again, why part of the inflationary market is people actually getting more dollars from the Federal Government. One of the reasons why there's been a push by many members of the government for the Federal Reserve to lower those interest rates is because they're hoping retail investors will take that money and then sync it back into the stock market.

Foreclosures are once again on the rise in the United States. New data from ATOM shows more homeowners falling behind on their mortgages amid job losses and soaring living costs. According to the Daily Mail, in October alone, there were 36,766 foreclosure filings. The first step up in the process when a lender warns a borrower they're in default. That's up 3% from September and 19% from a year ago. Today's homeowners have safer loans and the real estate values haven't dropped so dramatically. So, if a bank has to foreclose, it's not like it's going to completely take the legs out from under",

One is good and one is bad. The good thing that's happening is that that is the additional supply that you need in the market. So, if you're worried about not being able to afford a house, it turns out that when people can't afford their current houses and they get out and the bank has to seize that that house and then resell it, the price are going to go down. It's additional supply. But it is also a sign that people can't afford things right now. Both those things are true at the same exact time. Meanwhile, companies are cutting jobs. I mean, there's no question this is happening. Verizon is planning to cut roughly 15,000 jobs. The cuts are the largest ever for the carrier, according to the Wall Street Journal.

There's a lot of competition in this area for sure, but again, one of the things that we are seeing here is big companies that are running into headwinds clearly. Okay.

Now again there's no logic to this. The thing that actually makes people richer is innovation. The thing that actually makes people's lives better is innovation. Remember money is just a ruler. The amount of money you make is a ruler. What I mean by that is you use a ruler to measure things. The amount of money you make is a measurement of the goods that you can buy in exchange for the money. So you could titularly be making tons and tons and tons of money in a particular currency.

Now they're more about the means of distribution of cash. If they just redistribute all day long, this will somehow make Americans better off.

Now, the problem with this theory is it doesn't work. Punishing the rich doesn't make everybody richer. It just makes rich people poorer. That's all. And then everybody gets poorer because nobody has money to invest in innovation, for example. And I understand all the dispsia about innovation. I just talked about some of the dispsia in the middle of a bubble. Joseph Shumper, the famous economist, talked about creative destruction. He talked about the idea that when you have markets, free markets tend to make bad things in the market or less efficient things in the market obsolete and that destroys them. And in the short term, that looks bad. But it's creative because what grows out of that is something better. That if you want a",

The people who make wheels for wagons, those people will no longer actually have a job. But then they will find new jobs. And so in the moment, it'll look really bad. That's also true with regard to AI. I understand there are some of the AI doomers out there who believe that AI is going to take everybody's job. I don't believe that's the case. I think that AI will end up being a supplement in the way that virtually all other technologies are supplements to your jobs. There are certain jobs that will probably get automated out of existence where AI will do them. Ironically, those will likely be the very white collar jobs that the media was touting about 15 years ago. The members of the media were telling welders to code. Well, now it seems much more likely that coders are",

But the market will change and the market will move. Things will become more efficient. Everything will become cheaper. These are good things. Again, not to pretend there are no downsides to AI, particularly in the immediate term, but the sort of lite philosophy that if you take a technology out to a field and beat it to death with a hammer, that somehow you're going to be able to prevent the future from happening.

New York is never going to be as affordable as De Mo, Iowa. It's not going to nothing you do. There are no policy things you can do that will make New York as affordable as De Moines. Why? because there are a lot more people in New York and a lot less real estate in New York and a lot more demand and a lot less supply. So things will be more expensive in New York.

So, the administration lately has tried this. Again, this is nothing new. Barack Obama used to do this back when the economy under Barack Obama was bad, which it was. Barack Obama used to say that people just don't understand what we're doing. If we just articulate it better, then they'll understand that that tech never works. President Trump has been trying to do this a little bit. He's been going on shows and doing interviews in which in which he says that people just don't understand how good the economy is.

So, what strategies can actually be tried? Well, one strategy is to yell at the Fed. Hey, the administration has tried this also. Yelling at the Fed, telling them they need to lower those interest rates more to therefore inject more liquidity into the economy and that this somehow won't be inflationary. Here's the thing. All the Fed can do is control the money supply. That's all they do. They control the money supply. They do it directly and they do it indirectly. Okay? The indirect version is by lowering that open markets overnight rate. That is that's the way they they lower. You can go view a YouTube video that I did a few years back.

I think that inflationary policy has been significantly more damaging than the somewhat moderate delays in lowering those interest rates. Blaming Jerome Powell for stagnation at the you blame Jerome Pal for inflation. Blaming him for stagnation, I think, is another question. That's not going to do it. So, what could do it? Ironically, the Trump administration is now tacitly acknowledging that the tariff regime that they put in place actually does damage Americans at, for example, the supermarket. So yesterday, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries. The agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Ecuador come to come as President Trump faces scrutiny over his handling of the",
ben_shapiro_M1A2BO4tkhE_0790,ben_shapiro,M1A2BO4tkhE,1892.08,1934.7199999999998,"economy and concerns about affordability. As part of an initial framework, a reciprocal tariff of 10% will stay on goods from Guatemala, Argentina, and El Salvador, as will a 15% tax on imports from Ecuador into the US. But the deals will exempt products that cannot be produced in the United States in sufficient quantities like coffee. The US Argentina deal also addresses beef producers access to foreign markets. So um I'm just going to point out right now that this is a tacid admission that tariffs increase prices on American consumers. That's what it is. If you say I want the prices to go down on bananas and thus I have removed the tariffs on bananas. What does that mean? It means that yes, by restricting supply through tariffs to bananas, the",
ben_shapiro_M1A2BO4tkhE_0791,ben_shapiro,M1A2BO4tkhE,1933.2,1977.76,"prices of bananas go up. This is true for all other products as well. When you put tariffs on product, the prices tend to go up because of course you're putting an artificial restriction on the supply of the product. As we discussed yesterday and we'll continue to discuss, the laws of supply and demand are very basic. If the demand remains stable and the supply goes down, the prices go up. Again, if there are fewer bananas and the same number of people to buy those bananas and more people competing to buy those bananas, the price goes up. So, the president acknowledging that coffee is too expensive and bananas are too expensive. And thus, perhaps we should lower the tariffs on coffee and bananas. What if we took that logic and extended over a wide variety of other products? Would Wouldn't that be nice? That might",

And one of the things worth pointing out is that when the president says he's keeping blanket tariffs on countries like Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, Argentina, and then he says he's going to carve out things like bananas and coffee, that is a pretty giant carve out. In fact, I asked our sponsors over at Comet, a project of perplexity, what are the top products exported to the United States by Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, and Argentina?

Of course of course because basic economics is correct that if you wish to lower prices perhaps you should remove trade barriers on the countries that are going to supply you cheaper and better products.

Microsoft came out publicly in favor of legislation in order to stop the distribution of Nvidia chips. Officials at Amazon's cloud unit have said that they support it as well. Why?

Instead, they say we have to just keep pouring money down that rat hole. The biggest problem with Obamacare, of course, is that it redistributes healthcare coverage from young people to old people. That's what it does. It forces young people to buy a particular level of healthcare coverage in order to be covered in the Obamacare exchanges. And then they use that money to pay for older people and their health insurance.

The age ban imposed by Obamacare, which mandates that young people can't pay too much less than old people, should be eliminated. Obamacare taxes should be repealed. You should be able to buy catastrophic plans, particularly for people who are young because if you're young, your minor injuries aren't going to cost you that much money.

Well, it turns out the entire Republican caucus was right. What now? was the proper response to the idea that Representative Matt Gates should be attorney general of the United States.

Then he contacted her again and then they met up at a hotel where they had sex and she was paid another $400.

On July 15th, 2017, he asked the girl and others to attend a party at the home of Chris Dworth, a former Republican member of the Florida State House, who at the time worked as a lobbyist for Ballard Partners.

However, Democrats currently hold a 14 point advantage in this poll, which is a very, very large advantage. If that were to stick in the generic congressional ballot, you'd be looking at a Democratic wave in 2026. President Trump in this polling his approval rating is just 39%",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0829,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,85.2,129.2,"which is his lowest since right after January 6th. A combined six in 10 people blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the government shutdown which again well done legacy media for somehow spinning a completely Democrat cause government shutdown into a story about President Trump and Republican intrigence. Nearly 6 and 10 say that Trump's top priority should be lowering prices. No other issue comes close actually. So again, those are very bad numbers for the Republicans right now. What does that mean for the 2026 election? Well, in the fall of 2022, Democrats had a lead in the generic congressional ballot. They ended up losing nine house seats to the Republicans in 2020. In",

In 2014, when Obama was president, Republicans had a five-point advantage and the GOP gained 13 seats. the number of actual vulnerable districts has shrunk fairly dramatically. So even if Democrats have a gigantic advantage in the generic congressional balloting, again, the way that the districts are stacked up, there are a lot more solid Dem districts and a lot more solid Republican districts and fewer swing districts overall. In fact, we asked our sponsors over at Perplexity. They have a brand new web browser called Comet, and we asked, ""How many vulnerable Republican seats are there in the House for 2026? and what is",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0831,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,167.599,211.44,"the likely range of Democratic wins? And according to Comet, there are about 20 to 25 highly vulnerable Republican House seats going into the 2026 midterm elections based on expert forecasts and ratings of competitive districts. Those vulnerable seats are concentrated in swing districts with close 2024 results. There are a bunch of open seats to retirement, and there are areas with unfavorable demographic shifts for the GOP. Key battlegrounds include districts in Nebraska, Iowa, Pennsylvania, California, and New Hampshire. According to many analyses, 10 to 12 of those seats are currently ranked as toss-ups, and another 8 to 15 are listed as lean Democratic or lean Republican. So, all of those could shift depending on again how the generalized feeling about the",

So, what is the most likely outcome? Well, I mean, probably the upper end of disaster for Republicans is like 25 seats. 20 to 25 seats, which would put Democrats pretty solidly in control of the House. Now, it would take a massive Democratic wave in order for them to actually take the Senate. The Senate map for the Democrats is not good. Again, asking our sponsors over at Comet, the most vulnerable Senate seats for Republicans in 2026, and the likelihood of Republicans losing them. So, the two most vulnerable seats are in Maine and in North Carolina. Senator Susan Collins frequently a sort",

That Republican is going to look like Susan Collins. Susan Collins is a batler and a survivor up in Maine. She's the only Republican incumbent running in a state won by a 2024 Democratic presidential nominee. Meaning this is the only senator who is up for election as a Republican in a state. comma one. It is a top Democratic target that that of course is a very fraught seat. That race right now has as the leading Democratic candidate not the sitting governor of Maine but actually a radical Democratic",

And then you have North Carolina. that seat has opened up because Tom Tillis, a frequent target of the president, has decided that he is not going to run for reelect. And so that seat opens up and maybe that seat swivels blue. So that's two seats. But remember, Republicans hold 53 seats, which means that in order for Democrats to take control of the Senate, they would need to take two more. Right? So even assuming you lose Maine, you lose North Carolina, Republicans still have 51. The next most likely switches would be Texas, Iowa, and Alaska. Now, Texas is always the kind of great white whale for Democrats. They're always saying this",

John Cornin, of course, is facing a pretty dramatic primary challenge from Ken Paxton. Paxton is a significantly less good general election candidate than Cornin. So, that race could be a little bit dicey for the Republicans. Iowa is a very red state, but Joanie Ernst, who's a very popular senator, is leaving that seat open. And open seats get a little dicey. If it's a big Democratic wave in Iowa, you could theoretically see Republicans lose that Iowa seat and then that would take Republicans down to 50. And at that point, you'd have the vice president JD Vance breaking any ties in the Senate. There'd be no margin for error for the Senate Majority Leader John Thoon. There is one more race that is up for",

Sherid Brown, you'll recall, is one of the senators who just lost a race. He's now coming back. He he lost to Bernie Mareno. He's now coming back and he's going to race again. He was very recently a senator. So that's a vulnerable race as well. It's not in other words, it is not totally out of the range of possibility for Democrats to win the Senate. But it would take a lot for Democrats to win the Senate. If Democrats were to actively take the Senate, they would probably also need to take Alaska, which is again a red state. Dan Sullivan is a popular senator there. So it seems pretty unlikely that the Republicans lose both the House and the Senate. about losing the House would be bad enough. If they lose the House,",

It means that the House becomes a baton to wield against everything the Trump administration is trying to do on the executive level. So, this requires us to look at what exactly is happening here. Why is President Trump lagging in the polls now? Why is he at 39% 40%. How does he recover? So, there is a brand new Reuters Ipsos poll that also shows, just like that NPR poll, that Trump is in the high30s, that he's at 38%, which is the lowest rating he has had since he returned to power in January. What are the reasons for that? Well, it shows actually that the reason is not what people say that it is. So, people have been saying that it's his foreign policy, that that Trump's foreign policy",

It's his policy in Ukraine and in the Middle East, and it's all of his focus on foreign policy that's destroying the party. actually wrong. The only actually part of his policy right now that is wildly popular, at least by Trumpian standards, is his foreign policy. In fact, Trump's foreign policy, his approval ratings on foreign policy are better than any prior president of the modern era at this point in his term, which is kind of extraordinary for the amount of crap that he is currently taking in the very online spaces. Guys, get out and touch grass. It turns out most Americans like the stuff that President Trump has been doing on foreign policy, or at least a plurality of Americans like it. And here is Harry Entin talking about the president's approval ratings on foreign policy.",

Up like a rocket. We're talking about 43% now. That's an 8-point rise on the net approval rating. We're talking about a double digit rise. The American people like much more of what they're seeing from Donald Trump in foreign policy in term two than they did in term number one. >> Okay? So again, it ain't his foreign policy. It isn't immigration either. The president's net approval ratings on immigration have gone down, but that's largely because he has solved the immigration crisis in the United States.

But the part that Trump already solved, which was the big Biden problem, was leaving that southern border wide open, right? That was the part that that Trump solved. And because he solved that, now that problem is off the table. So Americans aren't even thinking about the southern border. If they were thinking about the southern border in comparison to Biden, his approval ratings would be 80%. But we've now reached the point in the presidency where if you solve the problem, that no longer actually acrrues to your benefit or downs to your benefit. Actually, it kind of goes away just in the mind. Like when's the last time you thought about the southern border? The answer is you don't because Trump solved it.

So, if you had to put your finger on the the two things that are sort of dragging Trump down in the approval ratings, it would be economic issues, which of course is true for every president, and yes, the Epstein stuff. Why the Epstein stuff? Well, Democrats were always going to disapprove of Trump on the Epstein stuff. Of course, because Democrats disapprove of Trump on literally everything he does. The reason that Trump has dropped in his approval rating on the Epstein stuff is because you have actors who are trying to use the Epstein stuff as a club against the president in order to seize control of the MAGA movement. That's what's happening. Okay? Trump has not done anything radically different about Epstein than Joe Biden did, for example. In fact, he has been",

In fact, the bill that just passed in the House and then in the Senate and the president signed, that bill, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, was only initiated in July of this year. Why?

But the people who have elevated this to the top of the issue stack are people who, shall we say, do not like the president's policy decisions. That's what this is about. I mean, here was Thomas Massie yesterday, a guy who's apparently going to stake his entire congressional career on the Epstein files, talking about the Epstein files again endlessly.

You can tell who's getting the strange new respect these days. When you're on the same side as Abby Phillips with regard to the Epstein files, you might want to think about it a little bit. I I do think that this loyalty thing with Trump, >> if you've covered him as I have, you know it's a one-way street. But she literally is learning that in real time >> right now. Yes. Literally. Yesterday she said, ""I've been so loyal to him and they're calling me a traitor. I think she is realizing that Trump is not there",

That's why she's pissed off. And so she's tried to turn this into a moment where she breaks the Republican party. And yes, that is going to have some impact on Republican levels of support for the president. Also, when you have popular podcasters and voices who continue to malign the president without saying his name because they're cowards, who continue to go out there and say that the administration is covering up the Epstein files, the administration without saying Trump's name because they don't want to offend Trump.

Okay. Well, it turns out Democrats are salivating at the prospect of going up against Mills. According to the Orlando Sentinel, multiple Democratic candidates are now looking at his district, which is the Florida 7th district. That would be a vulnerable district. Normally wouldn't be. That is a district that Mills in his last congressional election won, I believe, by 13 points. But historically, that has been a seat that has been held by Democrats before before Mills. So, if he's a bad candidate and if he's going to lose, it would certainly behoove him to get out of the way and it would behoove Republicans to push him out of the way",

Meanwhile, turns out again, Congress is filled with wonderful people. One of those wonderful people is apparently Congresswoman Sheila Sherfilis McCormack, another Congress person from Florida. So, my state is doing yman's work in Congress these days. Apparently, the DOJ is charging her with stealing $5 million in FEMA funds, laundering the proceeds, and then using the money to support her 2021 congressional campaign. She faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted. According to the indictment, the DOJ says that Sherilis McCormack, 46, and her brother Edwin Sherfilis, 51, both of Myiramar, worked through their family healthcare company on a FEMA funded CO9 vaccination staffing contract in 2021.",

Meanwhile, in some positive news for the Trump administration, so we've talked about the Epstein of it. We've talked about the the sort of drag effect on Republican approval ratings for President Trump. The biggest issue for the president obviously is the affordability issue is the econ as always as always. If people do not feel secure about the economy, then they start to blame that on the president of the United States. No matter who the president is, that's just the way it",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0867,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,1673.039,1717.36,"works. Whether it's fair or whether it's unfair. Okay. Well, a couple of pieces of good news for the president. So the September jobs report which was delayed for some 6 weeks and we don't know if there will be an October jobs report at all or when it will come out but apparently the US added 119,000 new jobs in September. That is above expectations of 53,000 jobs. The unemployment rate climbed but that's because more people are joining the job market. So that's what happens. Sometimes you can have an increase in jobs but the number of people who are now seeking a job has increased to outmatch that. That's what happened with the unemployment rate. So the the the question remains as to whether the Fed is going to cut the interest rates or not. If they believe that employment is slowing, they may in",

So the the Dow Jones Industrial Average today is likely to pop a little bit. That's because of the Nvidia earnings report that went out yesterday. So Nvidia has been just raking it in. And we've talked about some of the circular deals that are allowing for this to happen in which Nvidia buys stock in a private company like OpenAI. And OpenAI then takes that money and pumps it right back into Nvidia chips which pumps up Nvidia stock. So it's kind of a weird indirect version of a stock buyback in in in a way kind of. Well, Nvidia apparently continues to just sell and sell and sell and sell. According to the Wall Street Journal, Nvidia reported record sales",

As demand for the company's advanced AI data center chips continued to surge, that's up 62% from one year early and exceeded the consensus estimates. The company increased its guidance for the current quarter. They estimate that sales this quarter are going to reach $65 billion. So in pre-market trading on Thursday, the stock was already jumping. Jensen Huang said, ""We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. AI is going everywhere doing everything all at once.""

Jensen Hang is Taiwanese. He is here in the United States because his parents came here and his company is now worth more than the entire economy of Germany and it's based in the United States creating an awful lot of wealth and jobs. So that that is the good news. The good news is the employment market is turning along. More people are are joining the the lines to try and get a job again. The Nvidia profits were big. On the other hand, there's still a lot of nervousness. And the nervousness is not misplaced. Number one, we don't have data on the October unemployment rate. So, it's unclear exactly what the Federal Reserve is going to use for its guidance in",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0871,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,1843.2,1888.0,"terms of raising or lowering the interest rates or just keeping them the same. But meanwhile, Target is having trouble. So, at the retail level, people are just buying less stuff, which suggests that all the extra money that people have, a lot of it is going into the upper end of the tech market, but some of it's not bleeding down into the sort of basic everyday staples. According to the Wall Street Journal, Target's plan to fix its continuing sales slump involves billions of dollars in investment. Apparently, incoming chief executive Michael Fidelki said the retailer would invest about a billion dollars more next year to improve stores, its merchandise selection, and digital capabilities, bringing total new investment next year to $5 billion. That change will include store experience improvements and more exciting merchandise along with better",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0872,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,1885.84,1928.7990000000002,"tech and e-commerce systems. In recent years, shoppers have been complaining of messy stores, items missing on shelves, and less exciting products. Well, I mean, I I think there's truth to that. My family I my family and I routinely shop at Target. I will say that it's gotten messier over the years. It used to be a lot cleaner of a store. It used to be better run. So, there's truth to that. But the drop in profits, I don't think is entirely attributable to that. People might just be buying less because of the inflated price of things like groceries and basic staples. And now they're pulling back on their spending. This was the 12th consecutive quarter or week or falling sales for Target. The company said fewer shoppers visited its stores. Those who did spent less during the quarter. Comparable sales from those from stores and digital channels",

According to the Wall Street Journal, he said that Fideli, who is the CEO, he said that discretionary items like home decor and apparel are where they are really seeing a downturn. Not particularly on groceries, but on the other sort of stuff. Target has already been cutting jobs. So, are those stock market gains at the upper end of the market producing jobs in the same way? No. And that's not unusual. So, for example, in the aftermath of the dotcom bubble that burst in 2000 at the tail end of the Clinton administration, there was a fairly quick recovery in terms of the stock market under George W. Bush, but it took a little while for the jobs to come back because it turns out that when a bubble bursts, there tends to be",

The consolidation increases the revenues and profit margins of companies, but it takes a while for that to bleed down into I now want to hire additional people. Now again, there is some good news for the Trump administration here in for example the price of groceries. As I've said before, one of the big problems the Trump administration has in terms of the affordability argument is that what people actually want is not a thing that the Trump administration probably is capable of delivering and that is 2022 prices, 2020 prices, right? That very unlikely we're getting back to that level. So people in their own minds are not comparing what they paid for groceries this year to what they paid for groceries last year. If they were, that's kind of a small incremental increase or dead even. What they are",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0875,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,2010.32,2054.0,"doing is comparing the price of groceries this year to the price of groceries four years ago. And there really Biden did bake this into the cake. Once you have prices inflated by 10, 12, 15%. The only way the prices go back down 10 12 15% to what they were originally is a dramatic lack of demand. Because particularly with regard to groceries, a radical increase in supply very often is not possible. With that said, it is true, and the president has said this, that the inflation rates are are down pretty dramatically from the Biden years. According to Axios, the average classic holiday fees for 10 will run 55 bucks 18 this Thanksgiving per the American Farm Bureau's Federation new annual survey.",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0876,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,2051.599,2094.5600000000004,"That's about 5 bucks 52 per person, down 5% from last year. So, that actually is a decline. However, as they say, three years of declines don't fully erase dramatic increases that led to a record cost of 6405 in 2022. That estimate is based on turkey, sweet potato stuffing, and more. Cheaper turkey is driving a lot of the overall decline. So again, the Trump administration has been handed a a real bag when it comes to inflation and affordability and then been told to solve it. It ain't quite that easy. Now, when it comes to the matter of affordability, the big question for President Trump is what can he do about affordability? Well, there",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0877,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,2092.72,2137.599,"are two things he can do on immigration. One thing is he could take the unskilled immigrants who are here illegally and he could deport a lot of them. This would presumably be less of a drain on public resources. It would also presumably increase wages at the bottom levels. Now, that comes along with the increased prices of the things that those wages are used for. However, the the vice president has pointed out that it would take some pressure off of housing. That's probably true at least in the short term. He so so that's one aspect of immigration. And then the other aspect is you do need to bring in skilled immigrants. I know this has somehow become a very very controversial matter on the political right. There's big debate over H-1B visas. We've talked about the flaws in the H1B visa program which are quite real. people abusing it,",

But we do in fact need skilled immigrants coming into the country if you wish to make things more affordable because again the only way to make things more affordable on a basic econ 101 level is you increase supply and the demand stays the same or you reduce the demand and the supply stays the same. That is that's the only way to reduce prices because prices are a function of supply and demand. Those are the only two factors that are going into the prices. Now there are a lot of things that go into the supply and the demand. Everything from subsidies to regulation. However, if you wish for cheaper products, which is what affordability",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0879,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,2177.119,2220.7200000000003,"is. And again, I'm kind of amazed that we we constantly hear this drum beat from the right. We you know, all these Americans buying their their cheap foreign products. Well, what if Americans just want there's another word for Americans wanting to buy cheap products. It's called affordability, right? That's literally what that means. Doesn't have to be a foreign product, but it does have to be affordable. And if you wish for things to be affordable, then the inputs in making that thing also have to be cheaper and more plentiful. Okay? So, the president has taken a lot of flack from members of his sort of heritage American right, shall we say, about his comments on skilled immigration. This is not the president in favor of mass migration. This is the president saying what is clearly and obviously true, which is that if you",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0880,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,2218.96,2262.56,"have a factory and you do not have people who are capable of staffing that factory in fruitful fashion, you can't just take somebody off the unemployment line and have them producing missiles tomorrow. You may need at least temporarily to bring in some foreign skilled labor in order to make that factory run. Otherwise, the factory gets outsourced and then from tariffs it and it's expensive for Americans. This is all very very basic stuff, but the basic has now become controversial. Here is the president speaking at the US Saudi investment forum yesterday talking about skilled immigration. >> You can't come in open up a massive computer chip factory for billions and billions of dollars like is being done in Arizona and think you're going to",

And I'm going to welcome those people. Now, my I love my conservative friends. I love MAGA, but this is MAGA. And those people are going to teach our people how to make computer chips. And in a short period of time, our people are going to be doing great. And those people can go home where they probably always want to be. Okay? So, again, he is not wrong about this. He's taking an awful lot of flack for this. One of the things about President Trump is that the people who don't like Trump's policy very often wishcast his policy into something else.",
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0882,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,2302.48,2344.96,"So isolationists will wish cast his policy into a sort of paleocon isolationism which is not actually his policy or they'll wish cast his economic policy into some sort of economic autoarchy.

I hope that he uh I hope he has fun with that. Here is M Donnie saying that he will tell Tom Hman that this city is an immigrant city.

And we will protect those New Yorkers as we protect every New Yorker. So, um, does he mean illegal immigrants? Cuz apparently he does. And meanwhile, all of this is leading to where is the state of the current economy. So the Trump administration believes that if they can keep the interest rates low, if those interest rates can drop even more, they can spur demand. If they can spur demand, then presumably they will increase demand for labor, people will will have higher wages and all the rest. The problem is again, we have an inflationary economy. We do. Okay.

The Federal Reserve is considering not cutting the rates. I I would say that's the likelihood at this point. You have an economy that is overheated in terms of the stock market.

What he says is that strict limits on rent increases under 2019 laws in New York have left an estimated 50,000 apartments vacant across the city. Because the restrictions on what landlords can charge for these apartments often don't even cover the cost of maintaining them, they become ghosts. It's like they don't exist at all. Incoming New York Mayor Zar Madamani promised during his campaign to immediately freeze the rent for rent stabilized apartments, but those rents have essentially been frozen since 2019. At the time, the laws were widely heralded as the strongest set of rent regulations anywhere in America. They were designed to protect tenants from",

Actually, what has happened is that sometimes tenants die, sometimes tenants move, and if you can't raise the rent, well then it actually costs you more money to keep the apartment lights on with a renter there than it would be to just leave the apartment totally empty. New York's rent laws rely on vacancy controls, which means rents don't reset between tenants, right? So, just because somebody leaves doesn't mean you can charge a new higher rent to the new tenant. The government instead assigns a maximum rent for every rentstabilized apartment. That rent can't be meaningfully increased no matter how much money I have to spend on renovations. According to the authorities, the rent guidelines board, the average cost to",

After all the work was done, an apartment owner would still be upside down on that apartment because once again, it turns out the government policy usually achieves the reverse of the thing that it is attempting to achieve.

The federal judge overseeing the case questioned the validity of a grand jury indictment that charged Comey with lying to and obstructing Congress. US District Judge Michael Knowoff pressed prosecutors during a hearing on the events around the charges against Comey. They questioned whether the entire grand jury even saw the actual two-count indictment a magistrate judge received after grand jurors rejected one of the three charges proposed by the interim US attorney Lindseay Halligan. So apparently Halligan was called to the courtroom and he asked her to address the court and it appears that actually the grand jurors were not present when the original indictment and a narrower substitute were presented to,
ben_shapiro_HkYB_pZjPEM_0894,ben_shapiro,HkYB_pZjPEM,2795.359,2840.16,"the magistrate judge. Heligan said that the four person and another grand jury were present but not everybody in the grand jury.

Assistant US attorney Tyler Lemons suggested the replacement indictment was a necessity because the grand jury had turned down one of the proposed charges. Quote, ""They really had no other way to return it."" So a lawyer for Comey said there's no indictment. So the procedural misstep was tantamount to a complete bar to prosecution. So at the very least the government provided problems for itself. Maybe it's a procedural problem but you know basic competence would be a good thing. Meanwhile Pam Bondi has been talking",

Uh and at the same time, the president and his team have been saying over and over, you know, this is a Democrat-led hoax, which has led a lot of people to say, wait, what? Um the Epstein files aren't exactly a hoax. But what the White House is telling me is that's the perception of how the Democrats are handling it. They're not actually interested in it because of the victims. According to the White House, they're interested in it in order to score political points. Now,",

Uh, and so the White House is grappling with all of this, but in the meantime, their messaging is to lean into the revelations that we've learned about Democrats. They didn't want the files released and the Democrats released some of them and lo and behold, a whole bunch of Democrats are implicated in these release themselves.

Well, folks, there are some lessons that must be learned by Republicans from the elections of this week. The reality is, as I talked about a couple of days ago, the elections this week weren't just obviously in Virginia or in New Jersey or in New York City. Actually, Republicans did pretty poorly across the board. There's a point being made by Matt Cottonetti, now of the Wall Street Journal. He says the off-year Democratic wave flooded Republican safe harbors. Democrats flipped at least 13 seats in Virginia's House of Delegates. They plan to use their governing trifecta, control of the governor's mansion, and both legislative chambers to redraw the state's congressional map in their own favor. New Jersey Democrats now enjoy their largest assembly majority in 52 years. Georgia Democrats won two seats on the public service commission, that's",

One of the reasons for that is because the electricity prices have been spiking and have continued to kind of softly go up during President Trump's term. This obviously should be warning sign for Republicans. And when you look at the 2026 election, the importance of Republicans retaining the House, the Senate, it looks like Republicans are in fairly decent shape to retain. In order for Democrats to actually take the Senate in the next in the next election cycle, they would have to flip a rather unlikely seat like say Iowa. But in Congress, where Republicans basically have zero margin at this point,",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0936,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,124.96,168.64,"Democrats do not need to flip very many seats in order to take the House. So there are approximately according to Cook political report 16 toss up seats. Okay, those tossup seats right now 10 of those are held by Republicans. So that's not great for Republicans. When you look at another eight that lean Republican and 10 that lean Democrat, you're talking about kind of a a total possible variance of 34 seats. Now Republicans would have to do really really poorly to lose all of those. But again, they don't have to lose many of those to lose control of the House. they lose control of the House, all you're going to get all day long are hearings and investigations and impeachments. And we know that all of this is the case. And",

Midterm elections almost always go the direction of the party that is out of power. Since World War II, according to Newsweek, the president's party has lost an average of 26 House seats and 3 to four Senate seats in midterms. When the president's approval rating is below 50%, the losses tend to be more severe. Presidents with a sub50% job approval have seen their parties lose an average of 37 House seats, as opposed to when the president is popular, where they lose about 14 seats on average. So again, Republican enthusiasm seems to not be nearly as high as it is when President Trump is on the ballot, obviously.",

There are audiences that President Trump brought in who are beginning to move against President Trump. One of those is Latino audiences, Latino voters, which went very heavily toward President Trump in the last election cycle seem to be bleeding away in New Jersey and in Virginia. Latinos back the Democrats by huge margins. According to the Washington Post, exit polls show Democrats regaining strength with Latinos. That's not because Democrats are doing an extraordinary job. It's because presumably there has been so much focus",

It's another thing if there's stuff all over your TV about Abua being taken out and then deported. Now again, I think that all of that media coverage has been pretty terrible, overblown, inaccurate. But just speaking politically, obviously this is not redowning to the benefit of Republicans among Latinos at the very least. But the real issue here is the economy. And we all know that the real issue here is the economy. Every exit poll from this week, every single one said the economy was the number one issue. And the reality is that our economy is on some shaky footing. Not only because of the continued government shutdown which will end but because of a generalized feeling that the economic growth that we are",

The tech industry is really important, but if it's the entirety of your economic growth, you got a bit of a problem. And the reason that that is happening is because investors don't know where to put their money. That is due to tariffs. It is due to bizarre regulations. It is due to a generalized",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0941,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,334.56,378.88,"feeling of too much government involvement in private industry.

And that is a major problem. This is something that Republicans very much should be considering as they head into the next year. So, for example, there haven't been any Bureau of Labor Statistics data put out about job loss over the course of the last couple of months, but there are some private services that actually do put out numbers. ADP, a payroll processing firm, according to the New York Times, reported that employment at private companies fell in September, but rebounded modestly in October. An",

Data from LinkedIn, Bank of America, and other sources paint a similarly mixed picture. The bottom line is that the trend line seems to be going down when it comes to private sector employment. It hasn't changed dramatically during the since the summer. Employers are apparently not adding many jobs, but they've avoided resorting to widespread layoffs. So again, everybody is sort of holding steady, which is why it does feel as though the economy is on the edge. We've already seen that some major companies are planning mass layoffs. that be Amazon, UPS, IBM. Altogether, according to the New York Times, companies announced more than 150,000 job cuts in October, nearly",

And earlier this week, and really since the beginning of this week, there's been a relatively significant decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, there's a rather large sell-off on Tuesday. One of the things that's been happening in the market is because nobody knows where to put their money. They don't know how to invest in industries. Typically, if you're going to buy a stock, instead of thinking of stocks as though you're at the casino, you're supposed to buy a piece of a company that you like because you think it's a good company and it is likely to succeed into the future.

It feels like the market is doing fine, but is also kind of paralyzed. And that's the problem.

So there are drops for example from Palanteer which I think is a good stock but a plummeted 8% despite better than expected quarterly results. The magnificent seven big tech stocks fell 2.2% compared with a drop of less than 1% for the rest of the S&P 500. Tesla fell the most and it is because of the stock market valuations which are again wildly out of,
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0950,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,716.959,760.48,"whack with the earnings of these companies. That is why you end up with a $1 trillion package for Elon Musk. That is why. So, one of the yard sticks that I look at when I'm determining whether I think stocks are overvalued is the PE ratio. That is the price toearnings ratio in a stock. And typically, when you're looking at price to earnings ratio, you want to look for low price to earnings ratio. Means that a stock might be undervalued. If you have really, really high, that means you expect the stock to just explode. Well, right now, the current PE ratios at the top of the market are pretty much insane, like totally crazy. According to our friends over at Comet, my sponsors at Comet, a new web browser by Perplexity, the current PE ratios for the Magnificent 7",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0951,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,758.0,801.92,"as of November 2025, include Apple at 36. Okay, again, Benjamin Graham suggested 16 to 18, 36, Microsoft at 34, Nvidia at 53, Amazon at 34, Alphabet at 30. According to Comet, those figures reflect each company's trailing 12 month PE ratio as of the first week of November 2025. Tesla has the highest valuation by far, which is presumably why stockholders are desperate to keep Elon Musk there. So, for example, right at the moment, the price toearnings ratio on Tesla is 307. That is a that is a big bet that a lot of people are making on Tesla. And",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0952,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,800.48,844.16,"again, I love Tesla. I think it's a great company. I own a Tesla. I think Elon is a genius. Also, a PE ratio of 307 is unthinkable. Benjamin Graham, who's sort of the financial forebear of Warren Buffett and his ideological mentor when it came to markets, he said that a typical PE ratio that was in safe zone was 16 to 18. 307. 307 is what we are talking about for Tesla which feels you know a little wild to me frankly. Nvidia their PE ratio right now is 54. That's very high. Now Nvidia of course",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0953,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,842.16,885.92,"has huge earnings because companies are spending enormous amounts of money on their chips. But if that peters out do people really think that the stock is going to end up earning out 53 times the earnings? I mean serious question. If you take a look at Alphabet, the PE ratio on Alphabet right now is significantly better. Okay, that is 28, which is closer to reality. And fundamentals trading to me is always a safer bet than the sort of speculative trading. But the problem is that everybody doesn't know where to put their money. They want to make a quick buck. They're looking at the market. They're feeling like, okay, instead of investing in stocks that pay dividends, for example, stocks that have a nice",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0954,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,883.519,926.88,"steady cash flow, stocks that are a solid business with growth potential that is steady but isn't exponential. Instead, they're like, ""Okay, you know what? I'm going to jump on the bandwagon of one of the Mag 7."" And this is precisely why Tesla had no choice but to give a gigantic pay package to Elon Musk. So people are pointing out they're saying, ""Oh my gosh, in this time of economic hardship for so many people, why is Elon Musk getting a trillion dollar pay package?"" Well, the the answer, of course, is that it isn't cash. He's not being given a trillion dollars in cash. He's being given stock and incentives. And the reason for that is because if he were not if Musk were to break with Tesla, I think it's a fair assumption the stock would collapse. And everybody at the board knows it. According to the New York Times, Tesla",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0955,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,925.199,969.68,"shareholders on Thursday approved a plan that could make Elon Musk the world's first trillionaire. Now again the New York Times is contrasting this with the tax the rich candidacy of Zoran Mani. Okay. The market rationale for why Elon Musk is getting that pay package is because the shareholders meaning the people who actually own the company believe he is worth that. They believe that without Elon Musk's brain driving the next creative steps for Tesla, the stock is going to collapse into oblivion. Right? If you were to take the Tesla stock right now and you were to bring its price down to a 20 PE ratio, price to earnings ratio, then you'd have to divide the stock price by a factor of",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0956,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,968.0,1011.36,"15. And so what they're figuring is you're buying the future with Tesla. That's what the stock is. If you lose the future because you lose Musk and it just turns into a car company with some AI capacity, then you got a a major major problem. That has nothing to do with quote unquote taxing the rich. taxing Elon Musk is not going to fix the real issues with the market. The real issue with the market right now is that the middle bulk of the market is not being invested in. And one of the reasons that it's not being invested in is sure there are hungry speculators with too much cash in their pocket thanks to the free reign of free money for a very long time, but also there's tremendous uncertainty if you're in a service industry or manufacturing industry about the tariffs. That does make a gigantic",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0957,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,1009.6,1054.16,"difference. There's no question that people are confused and discombobulated by the day-to-day action of the administration. As I've been saying for literally the entirety of the Trump administration, if the administration pursued lower taxes, lower regulation, free trade agreements with everybody around China, the economy would be in better shape because the conditions that you need to succeed as a mid-level to smaller company are conditions that allow for the fullest freedom of action in the labor markets, in the export markets, in the input markets. That's what you actually need. And so to this this sort of economic policy where we keep sticking fingers in the pie is not going to make anyone",

But that has nothing to do with Elon and the attempt to kind of pin this on Elon and Tesla seems to merely some class envy directed at Elon. Now do again from a sort of generalized perspective. Do would would I buy Tesla stock at its current price? I would not on a personal level because that PE ratio is out of whack to me and I like to trade based on fundamentals. But the idea that somehow Elon Musk getting a big pay package is a justification of Zoran Mandani socialism is totally crazy. These two things are utterly unrelated. Zor Mandani's answer would be take away all the money of Elon Musk. Prevent those kinds of deals. Watch the stock of Tesla crater and all the stockholders go,
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0959,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,1093.44,1137.1200000000001,"down. Presumably that would somehow be better in some way. Remember that pay package is dependent on people voluntarily engaging in transactions with Tesla and buying their stock allowing for the issuance of new stock. That's where that money is coming from. The New York Times tries to admit this, you know, on paragraph 8 cuz that's what they do. They got a fib by omission and then later they buy it back. These are vastly different arenas to be sure, but that split screen reality speaks to a larger divide in American business and politics. On one side are billionaires like Mr. Musk and their many supporters, including President Trump, who see the financial success of a small group of executives as something to be celebrated and emulated. On the other are progressives like Mr. Mandani, a Democratic socialist, who are calling for something more akin to the social welfare systems of Western Europe. I",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_0960,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,1135.76,1180.64,"love how the New York Times keeps trying to pretend that he's just a Norwegian. Mandani, he literally said he hates capitalism. The DSA wants him to fullon nationalize housing in New York. his proposals involving, for example, gigantic rent freezes or governmentr run grocery stores.

This is why I've been saying for literally months, I'm not saying anything new here. If the economy goes down, it's an existential danger to the Republican party, meaning to the country.

Now listen, to be fair to President Trump, if you take a look at how they rose during Joe Biden's term in office, it of course was way higher. But there comes a point in a presidency, every presidency, where you can no longer say it's better than the last guy. You have to deal with the fact that inflation is still too high at nearly 3%.

Well, here's the president denying that the prices are going up. Yeah. Again, I I don't think that I I don't blame him, but I don't think it's a winning political pitch. >> So, uh I don't want to hear about the affordability because right now we're much less.

That we're working every day so that when the government gets open, we can, you know, basically fire hose new policies at the Senate and get everything that we can possibly think of accomplished this year if they open the government. So, President Trump, they're trying to slow down President Trump's agenda, but they're not going to be able to do it. They need to give up that thought and put the American people first.",

I have yet to see that money actually delivered and actually build the factory. Joe Biden used to say the same kind of stuff. Of course, he used to say, ""We're going to take tax dollars and we're going to ship sack and by tomorrow morning you're going to see one bajillion bajillion million jobs and ship man."" Yeah.

The Senate is apparently exploring some sort of plan in order to end the government shutdown. The Wall Street Journal reports that Senate Majority Leader Thun told Senate Republicans on Thursday they should expect to vote on a new proposal today, aiming to end the government shutdown, according to people familiar with the plan.

Obviously, government workers, many of them are not being paid. Low-income families are seeing cuts in SNAP. Airlines are cutting flights because of the FAA. The new proposal would apparently combine a short-term spending measure with a package of three fullyear funding bills covering the legislative branch, agriculture, and military construction, and veterans affairs. It was unclear whether the interim measure would keep the government open through mid December or January.

Democrats said no, no, no, no, no. And started screaming like babies. And we've now been in a government shutdown for well over a month. Well, Republicans now have a choice, which is, I think, a politically smart one. They're going to make some targeted concessions to Democrats.

And then Democrats did really well in New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City. And now Democrats are saying, ""This shutdown stuff is great for us. Maybe we should just continue it.

Well, the statement they're making is that they want the shutdown to end and they think that as a punishment to President Trump, Trump will make concessions and then Democrats will end the shutdown.

He shut down national parks to make people feel the pain. Republicans are not doing that. Republicans have been trying to minimize the damage while being in compliance with the law.

Well, a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to release full funding for November food stamps by Friday. That oral order came as many, many Americans, 42 million Americans, have lost access to some benefits under SNAP.

And we're going to have to do that across New York. But you can feel the energy and enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Hokll can't triangulate between the radical far-left socialist and",

A huge number of them are reliant on the state of New York, the state legislature, and the governor actually signing off on incredibly large tax increases in the state. And it's unclear at this point whether Hokll is going to go for that. And so she's sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place. If she attempts to raise taxes dramatically on people living in the state of New York, already one of the most overt taxed states in the country, then there will be a bit of a rebellion. If she does not, then presumably the progressive left is going to be deeply upset with her and maybe try to eat her alive. That that is an unenviable political position for her. >> Well, Ben, you're exactly right in your",
ben_shapiro_yhKn2VEun6E_1007,ben_shapiro,yhKn2VEun6E,3114.48,3158.559,"political assessment, but let's be clear. Kathy Hokll has already raised taxes on New Yorkers. She is the reason why we have the highest taxes in the entire nation. And it took less than 24 hours for Zora Mamami supporters to heckle her, to chant tax the rich, tax the rich, to run her off the stage, for her to change her position and say she's now open to raising taxes. She will be forced by a Democratun state senate, Democrat run state assembly with Mammi and the DSA, the Democrat socialists on the march to bend the knee at every opportunity. Kathy Hokll bends the knee. She is controlled by the radical far-left by Mandami and she will do that in the case of raising taxes. This was the situation with her endorsement of Mandami. She didn't intend to. She said",

There's one poll that suggests that that you are actually ahead in this race. But the biggest factor here is the fact that she has never been a popular governor or even a gubernatorial candidate. In the last election cycle in which Kathy Hokll ran against Lee Zelden, who of course is now the head of the EPA, she only won in the state of New York by something like five and a half points and that was in fact an off-year election just like this one will be.

We're very focused on turning out those lower propensity voters. As I pointed out before, we've worked on this in my district. We have the highest voter turnout of any congressional district in New York State. People are looking for a leader and a reason to get out and vote. And saving New York State, I mean, this is dire. This is dire for families. And that's only exacerbated when you look at the New York City mayor's race. People do not want Kathy Hokll. She failed as governor.

And so radicals are in fact taking over the Democratic Party. There's no question that they are the ones with the momentum at this point if the Democratic Party refuses to stand up and say no. So again, it's it's sort of fascinating the dynamic here. Ryan Enos is a political scientist at Harvard and he argues in his substack quoted in the New York Times today that Mamani's significance lies more in the fact that there was enough enthusiasm for change rooted in dissatisfaction with the status quo and anger at those who perpetuated that voters in a major election were willing to elect a true outsider candidate and to work hard enough to do so in the face of enormous establishment resistance.

Kevin Hasset, the chairman of the National Economic Council, he says that the inflation that we're seeing is actually coming down. It's moving in the right direction. Wages are going to increase.

I mean, think about it. If you look at uh the macroeconomic picture, the way you get inflation down is you don't have the government uh spend like crazy.

So again, perhaps that's true, but Americans have to see the results. This is one of the reasons why I have been against the Federal Reserve cutting the interest rates. I was against the rate cuts. I do not think that the current rate cuts are designed to actually do what the Federal Reserve is supposed to do, bring down inflation. Again, I've always been critical of the idea that you can have an agency with two mandates. For example, when you look at the Homeland Security Department, that department has been tasked with both facilitating legal immigration and ending illegal immigration. That's stupid. If you have two separate purposes, they should have two separate agencies. The Federal Reserve should not be charged with both keeping",

Keeping unemployment low is a function of innovation. It is a function of deregulation. It should not be a function of inflationary government policy. Using the central bank as your policy maker of first resort is a mistake and it leads to mistakes that tend to be inflationary in nature. Pretty rare that you get a Federal Reserve since the Great Depression that is deflationary in nature. They tend to favor inflation over deflation for obvious reasons. Well, now apparently the Federal Reserve is torn over an interest rate cut. According to the Wall Street Journal, officials are fractured over which poses the greater threat. Persistent inflation",

The rupture has complicated what looked like a workable plan less than 2 months ago, though investors think a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting is still more likely than not. When policy makers agreed to cut rates by a quarter% in September, 10 of 19 officials, a slim majority, pencled in cuts for October and December. Cutting rates at three consecutive meetings would echo the downward adjustments that Powell last made in 2019. You'll remember that what came after that was, you know, a gigantic inflationary spiral tapped off by co but then radically accelerating under Joe Biden.

Hawks are challenging the presumption of another rate cut and that is why presumably Jerome Pal has been sort of downplaying the expectations that there will be another rate cut in December. Again, it's hard to see why there should be a rate cut given the fact that liquidity conditions in the United States are not actually all that difficult. They're worse than they were a few years ago in terms of mortgages, in terms of car loans, but in terms of business loans, in terms of the ability to access capital for startups. That's not a liquidity problem. That's an innovation problem. That's an uncertainty problem. It generally is not a liquidity problem.

And that is up from 2.6%. That's below some of the forecast because of the tariffs. But is that due to a drop off in demand? We don't really know. Again, inflation in prices is a function not only of the amount of money in the economy, but also it is the effect of demand. If demand increases, then you tend to get higher prices. If demand decreases, then you tend to get lower prices. Well, again, the big question in all of this is how do you bring down prices? How do you bring down prices? Historically speaking, the way to make things affordable, the way to bring down prices is fairly simple. you increase",

That is just how markets work. That is how realities work. Any attempt to do anything else is going to be at best a band-aid and at worst radically counterproductive to the cause of bringing down the prices. And so intervening with governmentbacked programs is more likely to lead to inflationary policy than the opposite. One of my favorite charts is a chart showing the differences in prices between government subsidized products and non-government subsidized products over the course of the last 40 years in American life. Every single government subsidized product from education to",

Everything the government does not subsidize, the prices have gone down because that's how markets work. And so my advice for the Trump administration is to move less toward government solutions and more toward government getting out of the way. Deregulation, yes, lower taxes, less subsidies, fewer interventions in the market economy, more growth innovative policies. This is one of the reasons why I'm not a huge fan of this idea of now like a governmentbacked 50-year mortgage. All righty. Coming up, we'll get to affordability. We'll get to President",

ben_shapiro_MrpKVHd_1No_1045,ben_shapiro,MrpKVHd_1No,1381.12,1424.32,"mortgage to a 50-year mortgage. Now, one of the questions is why there aren't sort of natural 50-year mortgages. Why don't private lenders just offer a 50-year mortgage? And the answer is that private lenders don't offer 50-year mortgages because in many cases, they are illegal. Because the amount of money that you end up paying over the course of 50 years is so much more than the actual sticker price of a house that it's insane. If you're paying a fairly low interest rate on an $800,000 loan over the course of 50 years, you'll end up paying many times the original price of the house just in the interest because the the loan is is so long. Okay? So, you're actually losing money every month.",
ben_shapiro_MrpKVHd_1No_1046,ben_shapiro,MrpKVHd_1No,1422.159,1465.36,"Beyond that, the gamble that is being made by the lender at that point is that if you default, your house will be worth more than it was. Okay. Well, maybe that's true. But the problem is you are setting yourself up basically for a second subprime housing crisis. If ever the housing market drops off in terms of prices and all those banks then foreclose on the houses and they have valueless assets in exchange for money that they lent out, then you have a major banking crisis that actually ends up eating the system. That's a point being made by the Wall Street Journal editorial board. High home prices are a problem, having soared 56% since January 2020. Two reasons are excessive government spending that fueled inflation and historically low pandemic era interest rates. Which of",
ben_shapiro_MrpKVHd_1No_1047,ben_shapiro,MrpKVHd_1No,1463.44,1507.1200000000001,"course is right. Again, when you lower the interest rates, that is a subsidy to demand because maybe I wasn't thinking about taking out a mortgage at 7%, but I am thinking about taking out a second mortgage at 2%. The Federal Reserve then had to raise rates to bring inflation under control. The result, average monthly payments on a new home have climbed some 80% over the last 5 years. This means fewer young people can afford a home. The median age of first-time buyers this year reached an all-time high of 40 compared to the late 20s in the 1980s. Public surveys show the cost of housing is an acute worry for young Americans. So, President Trump has now been sold apparently on the idea of a 50-year mortgage by Bill Py, who runs the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The aim is to reduce monthly payments by amortizing the loan over a longer period. So, instead of paying down the",
ben_shapiro_MrpKVHd_1No_1048,ben_shapiro,MrpKVHd_1No,1505.919,1550.0,"principal over 30 years, which is already a super long loan, by the way, most countries do not offer 30-year mortgages. Borrowers would now have 50 years to do it. So, again, a 50-year mortgage, as I've said, it would cut monthly payments, but it would also radically increase the amount of interest that borrowers pay over the life of the loan. Also, borrowers may have to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the enormous risk that sometime over the next half century, you're going to default. And as the Wall Street Journal points out, this has happened before. As the housing bubble inflated, Fanny May began buying more 40-year mortgages, which let borrowers take out bigger loans than they could otherwise afford. Borrowers were slower to build equity. Many walked away from their mortgages when the home prices collapsed. Or look at the",
ben_shapiro_MrpKVHd_1No_1049,ben_shapiro,MrpKVHd_1No,1547.6,1591.679,"subprime auto market. As car prices rose with inflation, auto dealers extended the duration of loans for less creditworthy borrowers. Some struggling borrowers are now turning in their keys and leaving lenders with big losses. So again, the only way to truly do a 50-year mortgage is to have some sort of government back stop. And a government backs stop, you're looking at too big to fail. Repeat of 2008. It turns out that government invention intervention into the economy tends to create inflationary policy, not affordability. Okay. The the the president is in fact, however, pursuing some policies that are supply side policies intended to bring down the prices. One of those, for example, is the president's push for",

According to the Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration is poised to unveil a plan that would allow oil drilling off the California coast. According to people familiar with the matter, and of course, Gavin Newsome is eager for this. He loves fights. The announcement is expected to include a proposal for drilling around Alaska in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. That's part of the drill baby drill campaign that President Trump was pushing. And that, of course, is good policy. Increasing supply is a good policy. It brings down the price. If you're worried about the price of oil, then actually increasing the supply of domestically produced oil is a very, very good thing. President Trump has said he can rapidly cut Americ's energy cost by 50% or more by expanding oil and gas production.",

With that said, are we anywhere near that? At this point, we are not. In April, Interior Secretary Doug Bergam directed his agency to begin a plan to develop a schedule for offshore oil and gas lease sales. The plan was part of the administration's focus on responsible offshore energy development. Again, this is good supply side policy, and I hope that the president continues to pursue it.

There are lots of things in life that are more important than affordability. However, if you are simultaneously complaining about affordability and also seeking to restrict the supply of an item, then what you are saying is logically and economically incoherent.

Okay, this is why I find it fascinating that there is so much talk these days about H-1B visas. Okay, now there are many problems with the H1B visa program. You can make the claim, I think somewhat accurate, that the H-1B visa program is too broad. The H-1B visa program about 65,000 are offered every year. Enormous number of renewals of people who have been in under H-1B visas before. I asked our sponsors over at Comet to explain this. It's a project of perplexity. H-1B visas are a US immigration program that allows employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations that require at least a bachelor's degree or equivalent expertise. Around 85,000 new H-1B visas",

That means somebody got an H-1B last year and now they got it renewed for this year as well. So, you're bringing in foreign workers mainly in tech. Something like 50% of all H-1B visas are are coming in the tech industry. There are people who are coming over to work in computer engineering or computer science or something. They're working for Intel or they're working for Microsoft or they're working for Google. This has become a point of contention on the right, not because of the usual reasons that the right is concerned about immigration, but for economic reasons. So there are lots of reasons to be concerned about legal immigration in the United States, not just illegal immigration, legal immigration. So for example, if you are bringing in people",

Now, if we're talking about pricing of labor, there's no question obviously that you bring in more people who are applicants for a job and the price of the labor goes down. That is a deflationary policy. Just in terms of affordability, it makes products more affordable. If labor is cheaper, products are more affordable. For the",

The question is how widespread are the beneficiaries and how discreet are the people who are being hurt and vice versa. Like let's be adults about how we discuss economics when we're going to talk about these big issues. Okay? So here is the case for importing certain types of labor.

When Laura says she's interested in raising American wages, everyone's interested in raising American wages. But the problem is this. If you raise the American wages, and you raise the American prices faster than the wages, then the wages get eaten up by the price increases. This is what happened during the Biden administration. You need two things. Increased wages and lowering prices. And the way that you do that is with innovation and with increased supply. That is how that works. You need both of those things.

Short-term thinking here is the enemy of actual economic health.

In Christianity, as early as the 6th century, there were people who are who are already moving to ban plural marriage. Took another thousand years for that to be made official.

Um but but uh Starship is the first time that there is a design for a rocket where where full and rapid reusability is actually,
joe_rogan_O4wBUysNe2k_0081,joe_rogan,O4wBUysNe2k,1472.559,1516.559,possible. So it was not there's not there's not even been a design before where it was possible. Certainly not a design that that that got made any hardware at all. Um just we just we just live we live on a planet uh where the gravity uh is is is quite high like earth's gravity is quite really quite quite high. Um um and if the gravity was even 10 or 20% uh higher uh we'd be stuck on Earth forever. Um like we yeah we could not use certainly couldn't use conventional rockets. You'd have to like blow yourself off the surface with like a nuclear bomb or something crazy. Um so but on the other hand if if Earth's gravity was just a little lower like,
joe_rogan_O4wBUysNe2k_0082,joe_rogan,O4wBUysNe2k,1514.0,1556.24,"even 10 20% lower it then uh getting to orbit would be easy. So it's like it's like it's like this if this was a video game it's set to like maximum difficulty but not impossible. >> Okay. >> Um so that's that's where we have um here. So it's it's not as though um others have uh ignored the concept of reusability. they've just uh concluded that it was too difficult to achieve. And we've been working at on on this for a long time at at SpaceX. Um and um you know, I'm the chief engineer of the company.

Um uh it's it's an honor to work with such such incredible people. Um so uh so so it's fair to say that you know we have not yet succeeded in creating in achieving full reusability but we at last have a rocket uh where full reusability is possible. Um and I think I think we'll achieve it next year. So um uh that's a that's a really big deal. And the reason the reason that's that's such a big deal is that full reusability um uh drops the cost of access to space,

The you can think of it like any mode of transport. Like imagine if aircraft were were not reusable. Like you flew somewhere, you throw the plane like like imagine if like the way the way conventional rockets work is it would be like if you had an airplane and and and instead of landing at your destination, you parachute out um and the plane crashes somewhere and you land at your desk and you and you land on a parachute at your destination.

People have trouble taking photos of UAP because they're literally taking a photo through a space war a space-time bubble basically the warping of space time.

And my hypothesis for what's going on here is that basically you as a creature with a very complex set of hazards and opportunities in your life. Use nighttime when you're not doing productive work to get ahead on challenges that you may face in one way or another. Sometimes those challenges,
