It doesn't seem like there is a lack of liquidity in the economy. Typically, you lower the interest rates when there's a lack of liquidity, when it feels like there's an economic contraction that's happening. You're not going to lower the interest rates when the economy is running hot and when the stock market continues to churn and when the inflation rate is still riding about 50% higher than the Fed's target rate.

And so America could send a bunch of money to Europe and then produce all the products here because literally there was no industrial base anywhere else on planet Earth. They'd all been destroyed by World War II. And then you could work one income and you could still do that. That was actually not the way that virtually all work was done in the United States ever.

He says the off-year Democratic wave flooded Republican safe harbors. Democrats flipped at least 13 seats in Virginia's House of Delegates. They plan to use their governing trifecta, control of the governor's mansion, and both legislative chambers to redraw the state's congressional map in their own favor.
