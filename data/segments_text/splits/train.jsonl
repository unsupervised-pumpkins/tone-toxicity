I mean again why this is controversial is beyond me. I understand that there are a lot of dumb theories that emerge from the universities. There is no reason the taxpayers should subsidize it. There are some members of the university faculty who are upset because they believe that they should be able to do whatever they want with other people's money. Martin Peterson, a philosophy professor, said it was quote tempting to agree no academic system course should advocate race or gender ideology since no serious academic course should promote any ideology. But he said seeking truth sometimes meant exploring contested ideas. But okay, if you say here's gender ideology and here's what his critics say, my guess is that the presidents of the university will greenlight that course.", "toxicity": 0.4}
